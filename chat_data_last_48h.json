You must expand each section with complete, detailed content based on your knowledge of the actual implementation.\nImplementation Checklist\nThis checklist must be followed step-by-step when implementing Task 46.8:\n1. Remove ALL Signal File References \u274c\nFiles to clean:\n\n docs/signal-format.md - DELETE ENTIRE FILE (obsolete signal architecture)\n tasks.json - Remove tasks 37.1-37.5 (signal file tasks)\n completed_tasks.json - Remove signal file implementation history\n docs/cursor-chat-discovery.md - Remove \"signal-based workflow\" references\n docs/architecture.md - Update workflow descriptions to remove signal mentions\n\nSearch terms to find and remove:\n\n\"signal file\", \"signal_management\", \"create_tool_signal\"\n\".mcp-commit-story/signals\", \"signal-based\", \"signal architecture\"\n\"call_mcp_tool\" (old placeholder function)\n\n2. Rename and Refactor Cursor Documentation \u270f\ufe0f\nAction: Rename docs/cursor-chat-database-research.md \u2192 docs/cursor-database-implementation.md\nRequired sections (EXPAND EACH WITH FULL DETAILS):\n\nOverview - Complete description of cursor_db package purpose and capabilities\nBackground Research - Condense findings but keep essential discoveries\nImplementation Architecture - Document ALL components and their interactions\nTechnical Details - Include actual queries, data structures, performance metrics\nDesign Decisions - Explain EVERY major choice with rationale\nLimitations & Considerations - Be thorough about constraints\nAPI Reference link\n\n3. Create Comprehensive API Guide \ud83d\udcda\nCreate docs/cursor-db-api-guide.md\nEXPAND these sections with complete documentation:\n\nOverview with clear value proposition\nQuick start with working example\nComplete API reference - Document EVERY public function with:\n\nFull function signatures\nParameter descriptions\nReturn value specifications\nMultiple usage examples\nError scenarios\n\n\nCommon workflows - Add 5+ real-world examples\nPerformance considerations with actual metrics\nTroubleshooting - Cover all common issues\nIntegration examples - Show real usage patterns\n\n4. Update Core Project Documentation \ud83d\udcdd\nEngineering Spec Updates:\n\nAdd \"Cursor DB Package Architecture\" section under SQLite Database Integration\nFully document component architecture, not just list them\nInclude detailed data flow diagrams\nDocument all design trade-offs\nUpdate TOC\n\n5. Remove Outdated Content \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\n\n Merge valuable content from cursor-chat-discovery.md then delete\n Remove ALL \"research\" framing - change to \"implementation\"\n Update architecture.md to show current flow (no signals)\n Remove any prototype/experimental code references\n\n6. Verify Documentation Consistency \u2705\n\n Test EVERY code example to ensure it works\n Verify ALL function signatures match actual code\n Check that performance numbers reflect reality\n Test all internal documentation links\n Ensure consistent terminology throughout\n\n7. Final Cleanup Verification \ud83d\udd0d\nRun these checks and fix any findings:\nbashgrep -r \"signal\" docs/ --include=\"*.md\" | grep -v \"# signal\"\ngrep -r \"call_mcp_tool\" . --include=\"*.py\" --include=\"*.md\"\ngrep -r \"research\" docs/ --include=\"*.md\" | grep -i cursor\ngrep -r \"\\[.*\\](.*\\.md)\" docs/ --include=\"*.md\"\nImplementation Order:\n\nDelete signal-format.md and clean references\nRename and fully rewrite cursor documentation\nCreate comprehensive API guide (not just outline)\nUpdate Engineering Spec with complete cursor_db details\nClean up outdated content\nVerification pass with fixes\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n\nZero signal file references remain\nCursor documentation is complete implementation guide\nAPI guide has working, tested examples for all functions\nEngineering spec fully documents cursor_db architecture\nAll documentation is consistent and accurate\nAll code examples actually run without errors\n\nRemember: The examples provided are MINIMUM starting points. Expand them with comprehensive details from your knowledge of the implementation.

Use discover_all_cursor_databases() on the current project directory to find all state.vscdb files for this specific project.

The research script should:\n\nCheck if all messages have the 'role' field\nVerify values are consistently 'user'/'assistant' (or document what values actually exist)\nNote any messages missing role fields or having unexpected values\nThis ensures our limiting logic will work with actual data\n\n3. Research Pause Point:\nYes, make it crystal clear when human input is needed.

But here are some better approaches:\nOption 1: Use AI timestamps to identify real sessions\nLook for gaps in AI message timestamps (e.g., 30+ minutes = new session). This would give us actual development session boundaries rather than arbitrary 100-message chunks.\nOption 2: Analyze by database age\nLook at the modification times of the 7 databases. If they span several days/weeks and only contain 910 total messages, that suggests much lower than 200/200 per 48 hours.\nOption 3: Be transparent about the limitation\nUpdate the research findings to acknowledge that without human message timestamps, we can't validate true 48-hour patterns. Instead, we're making a conservative estimate based on:\n\n910 total messages across all databases\nMessages appear evenly split between human/AI\nThis represents days/weeks of development work\nTherefore 200/200 per 48 hours is very conservative\n\nI think Option 3 is fine - just update the findings to be clear about what we actually measured vs. what we're inferring.

The research already validated these are extremely conservative (typical usage is ~35 messages per type), so there's no value in adding configuration complexity. Just call limit_chat_messages() with the hardcoded constants:\npythonfrom mcp_commit_story.cursor_db.message_limiting import limit_chat_messages, DEFAULT_MAX_HUMAN_MESSAGES, DEFAULT_MAX_AI_MESSAGES\n\n# In collect_chat_history():\nlimited_history = limit_chat_messages(\n    chat_history, \n    DEFAULT_MAX_HUMAN_MESSAGES,  # 200\n    DEFAULT_MAX_AI_MESSAGES       # 200\n)\n2. ChatHistory vs ChatConversation Objects:\nCorrect - ChatConversation doesn't exist yet. You'll need to define it in context_types.py as part of 48.2. The existing ChatHistory only supports a flat message list, so for 48.2's segmentation feature, you'll need to either:\n\nExtend ChatHistory to support a list of conversation segments, or\nCreate a new return type that wraps multiple ChatConversation objects\n\nKeep it simple for the MVP - just enough structure to represent conversation boundaries.\n3. Error Handling Priority:\nExactly right - when cursor_db fails (import errors, no workspace, etc.), return empty results gracefully. No fallback needed. Add telemetry to track these failures but always prioritize returning something over crashing. The journal generation can work with partial data.\n4. Since Commit Parameter:\nGood catch - don't add a TODO. Instead, document this in the engineering spec under a \"Future Feature Enhancements\" section. Something like:\n\n\"Git commit boundary integration: The since_commit parameter is currently reserved for future use. Future enhancement could filter messages based on git commit timestamps to provide more precise context boundaries.\"\n\nAdditional Implementation Notes:\n\nRemember that cursor_db returns prompts and generations in separate collections (not alternating) - they're stored in different database tables\nOnly AI generations have timestamps; user prompts don't",

If so then revise task 50 to incorporate it\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Dependencies:\nDependencies: [57, 58]\nReplace the entire Details section with:\nDetails:\nThis task creates a standalone journal generator that runs from git hooks without requiring the MCP server, building on the AI invocation (Task 57) and conversation reconstruction (Task 58) infrastructure:\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe standalone generator implements a layered architecture that separates concerns:\n\n### Layer 1: Context Collection (Programmatic)\nThree context collectors that gather raw data without AI:\n- `collect_git_context(commit_hash)` - Extracts git metadata, diffs, and commit info\n- `collect_chat_history()` - Queries cursor_db for raw prompts/responses (returns separate databases)\n- `collect_journal_context()` - Reads existing journal entries, reflections, and manual context (Task 55)\n\nThese functions are pure data extraction - no AI interpretation needed.\n\n### Layer 2: Conversation Reconstruction (AI-Powered, Task 58)\nSince cursor_db returns user prompts and AI responses in separate collections, and user prompts lack timestamps:\n- `reconstruct_conversation(raw_chat_data)` - Uses AI to intelligently merge the separate databases\n- Handles mismatched counts, missing responses, multiple prompts\n- Returns unified conversation flow that generators can use\n- This is the first AI invocation in the pipeline\n\n### Layer 3: Orchestration (Coordination)\nThe orchestration layer in `standalone_generator.py` coordinates the entire flow:\n1. Calls all context collectors to gather raw data\n2. Invokes conversation reconstruction (Task 58) to unify chat data using AI\n3. Builds the `JournalContext` structure with all collected data\n4. Iterates through section generators, determining which need AI\n5. For programmatic generators: calls directly\n6. For AI generators: uses AI function executor (Task 57)\n7. Assembles the complete journal entry from generated sections\n8. Handles errors gracefully - if one section fails, others continue\n9. Saves the final journal entry to the appropriate file\n\n### Layer 4: Section Generators (Mixed AI and Programmatic)\nSeven generator functions in `journal.py` with different execution patterns:\n\n**Programmatic Generators** (can be implemented without AI):\n- `generate_commit_metadata_section()` - Pure git data extraction\n- `generate_technical_synopsis_section()` - Could analyze code changes programmatically\n- `generate_file_changes_section()` - Git diff analysis\n\n**AI-Powered Generators** (require AI interpretation):\n- `generate_summary_section()` - Creates narrative summary of changes\n- `generate_accomplishments_section()` - Interprets what was achieved\n- `generate_frustrations_section()` - Identifies challenges from context\n- `generate_tone_mood_section()` - Detects emotional indicators\n- `generate_discussion_notes_section()` - Extracts key conversation excerpts\n- `generate_decision_points_section()` - **NEW** - Identifies moments where decisions were made\n\nEach AI generator:\n- Has an AI prompt in its docstring describing what to generate\n- Returns a placeholder (empty TypedDict or list)\n- Gets executed by the AI function executor (Task 57)\n\n### Layer 5: AI Invocation (Task 57)\nThe AI invocation happens at two points:\n\n1. **Conversation Reconstruction**:\n   - AI analyzes separate prompt/response databases\n   - Intelligently matches and merges them\n   - Handles edge cases and mismatches\n\n2. **Section Generation**:\n   - `execute_ai_function(func, context)` - Executes AI-powered generators\n   - Reads the docstring prompt\n   - Formats context and sends to AI provider\n   - Parses AI response into expected return type\n   - Provides graceful degradation (returns empty section if AI unavailable)\n\n## Decision Points Section (NEW)\nAdd a new generator for capturing decision moments. This AI-powered generator should extract moments where architectural, design, or implementation decisions were made, looking for explicit decisions, trade-off discussions, reasoning for choices, and pivots or changes in approach.\n\n## Complete Data Flow\n1. Git hook triggers \u2192 `process_git_hook()`\n2. Orchestrator called \u2192 `generate_journal_entry_standalone()`\n3. Context collectors gather \u2192 git data, chat history (raw), journal content\n4. **AI Call #1**: Conversation reconstruction \u2192 unified chat from separate databases\n5. Build JournalContext with reconstructed conversation\n6. For each generator:\n   - Programmatic ones: execute directly\n   - **AI Call #2+**: AI generators via executor\n7. Assembly \u2192 sections combined into complete journal entry\n8. Save \u2192 journal entry written to daily file\n\n## Key Implementation Components\n\n### Main Orchestration Function\nCreate `src/mcp_commit_story/standalone_generator.py` with the main orchestration logic that coordinates all layers described above.\n\n### Update git_hook_worker.py\nModify to call the standalone generator instead of creating signals, maintaining backward compatibility where possible.\n\n### Section Generator Management\nCreate a registry or list of section generators that distinguishes between programmatic and AI-powered generators for appropriate execution.\n\n## Dependencies on Other Tasks\n- **Task 57**: Provides AI invocation infrastructure and `execute_ai_function()`\n- **Task 58**: Provides `reconstruct_conversation()` for merging chat databases\n- **Task 55**: Provides `collect_journal_context()` for existing journal entries\n- **Task 56**: Already complete - terminal command collection has been removed\n\n## Notes\n- Terminal commands section has been removed (Task 56 complete)\n- Not all sections require AI - some can be pure data extraction\n- AI is invoked multiple times: once for reconstruction, then for each AI-powered section\n- System degrades gracefully if AI unavailable\n- The decision points section is a new addition based on user needs\n\n## Testing Strategy\n1. Unit test each component with mocks\n2. Integration test with real AI invocation\n3. End-to-end test with actual git commits\n4. Performance testing to ensure <10s execution\n5. Test graceful degradation when AI unavailable\n6. Test mixed execution of programmatic and AI generators\nUpdate the subtasks:\nPlease update the subtasks for Task 50 to:\n\nCreate standalone orchestration function with layer separation\nUpdate git hook worker to call standalone generator\nImplement mixed generator execution (programmatic vs AI)\nAdd decision points section generator\nIntegration testing with Tasks 57 and 58",
