### 2025-05-20 06:43 — Commit 5be3ac7

## Summary
Implemented and thoroughly tested the `get_commits_since_last_entry` function, ensuring robust, real-world-safe logic for journal entry generation. The function now correctly prevents duplicate journal entries and passes all edge case tests. This commit also refactored the test fixture for Git repos, updated related tests, and marked the relevant Taskmaster tasks as done.

## Accomplishments
- Wrote comprehensive TDD tests for `get_commits_since_last_entry`, covering edge cases (journal-only tip, no journal entries, empty repo, etc.)
- Refactored the Git repo test fixture to require explicit commit setup, improving test predictability
- Implemented `get_commits_since_last_entry` to prevent duplicate journal entries and handle all edge cases
- Updated Taskmaster tasks and documentation to reflect completion
- All tests now pass, confirming robust and production-safe logic

## Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Debugging the candidate commit selection logic was tricky due to the order of commits returned by `repo.iter_commits('HEAD')`
- The interaction between test expectations and real-world safety required careful alignment
- Ensuring no duplicate journal entries required several iterations and deep inspection of test/debug output

## Terminal Commands (AI Session)
- `pytest tests/unit/test_git_utils.py | cat`
- `git show --stat 5be3ac7 | cat`
- `git show 5be3ac7 --patch-with-stat | cat`
- `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`
- `whoami`
- `git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h' 5be3ac7`

## Discussion Notes
Human: Wouldn't skipping the tip if it's a journal-only commit cause duplicate journal entries?
Agent: Yes, skipping the tip and then looking for the next most recent journal entry would risk generating duplicates. The correct logic is to return an empty list if the tip is a journal-only commit, ensuring no duplicates are created.
Human: Please implement that logic.
Agent: Implemented. All tests now pass and the logic is real-world-safe.

## Tone/Mood
Relieved, methodical, and satisfied—debugging was challenging but the solution is robust and well-tested.

## Behind the Commit
- The commit includes 187 insertions and 32 deletions across 6 files.
- Major changes: `src/mcp_journal/git_utils.py` (function implementation and debug), `tests/unit/test_git_utils.py` (TDD and fixture refactor), and Taskmaster task status updates.
- The solution was iteratively refined through TDD, debug output, and careful alignment of test and production logic.
