### 2025-05-20 06:45 — Commit 5be3ac7

## Summary
Implemented and thoroughly tested the `get_commits_since_last_entry` function, ensuring robust, real-world-safe logic for journal entry generation. The function now correctly prevents duplicate journal entries and passes all edge case tests. This commit also refactored the test fixture for Git repos, updated related tests, and marked the relevant Taskmaster tasks as done.

## Accomplishments
- Wrote comprehensive TDD tests for `get_commits_since_last_entry`, covering edge cases (journal-only tip, no journal entries, empty repo, etc.)
- Refactored the Git repo test fixture to require explicit commit setup, improving test predictability
- Implemented `get_commits_since_last_entry` to prevent duplicate journal entries and handle all edge cases
- Updated Taskmaster tasks and documentation to reflect completion
- All tests now pass, confirming robust and production-safe logic

## Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Debugging the candidate commit selection logic was tricky due to the order of commits returned by `repo.iter_commits('HEAD')`
- The interaction between test expectations and real-world safety required careful alignment
- Ensuring no duplicate journal entries required several iterations and deep inspection of test/debug output

## Terminal Commands (AI Session)
- `pytest tests/unit/test_git_utils.py | cat`
- `git show --stat 5be3ac7 | cat`
- `git show 5be3ac7 --patch-with-stat | cat`
- `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`
- `whoami`
- `git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h' 5be3ac7`

## Discussion Notes
Human: Wouldn't skipping the tip if it's a journal-only commit cause duplicate journal entries?
Agent: Yes, skipping the tip and then looking for the next most recent journal entry would risk generating duplicates. The correct logic is to return an empty list if the tip is a journal-only commit, ensuring no duplicates are created.
Human: Please implement that logic.
Agent: Implemented. All tests now pass and the logic is real-world-safe.

## Tone/Mood
Relieved, methodical, and satisfied—debugging was challenging but the solution is robust and well-tested.

## Behind the Commit
- The commit includes 187 insertions and 32 deletions across 6 files.
- Major changes: `src/mcp_journal/git_utils.py` (function implementation and debug), `tests/unit/test_git_utils.py` (TDD and fixture refactor), and Taskmaster task status updates.
- The solution was iteratively refined through TDD, debug output, and careful alignment of test and production logic.

### 2025-05-20 06:55 — Commit f9912be

## Summary
Standardized and improved all function docstrings in `git_utils.py` for clarity, completeness, and project convention. Verified the documentation and implementation by running all unit tests, which passed successfully. This completes Task 3.12 and marks all of Task 3 as done.

## Accomplishments
- Updated every function in `git_utils.py` with clear, actionable docstrings (summary, args, returns, exceptions, notes)
- Removed stray debug statements and ensured docstring consistency
- Ran the full test suite for Git utilities (31 tests, all passed)
- Marked Task 3.12 and Task 3 as done in Taskmaster

## Frustrations
- Minor tedium in ensuring every docstring followed the exact project convention
- Needed to cross-check for any leftover debug prints or ambiguous documentation

## Terminal Commands
```
pytest tests/unit/test_git_utils.py
```

## Discussion Notes
Human: Please standardize and improve all function docstrings, then verify with tests and mark Task 3.12 as done.
Agent: All docstrings have been updated for clarity and completeness, and all tests pass. Task 3.12 and Task 3 are now marked as done.

## Tone/Mood
Relieved, methodical, and satisfied with the improved documentation quality.

## Behind-the-Commit
This commit ensures that the Git utilities are not only robust and well-tested, but also easy to understand and maintain for future contributors. The documentation now serves as a reliable reference for both users and developers, supporting the long-term health of the codebase.
