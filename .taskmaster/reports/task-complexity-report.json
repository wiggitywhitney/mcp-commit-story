			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the SQLite Workspace Detection and Reader implementation into subtasks including: 1) Platform-specific path detection module, 2) Core database connection and query functions, 3) Error handling and custom exceptions, 4) Schema validation and integrity checks, and 5) Testing framework implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves cross-platform compatibility, database access, error handling, and performance optimization. The complexity comes from handling multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL), implementing proper error handling with custom exceptions, and ensuring robust database access with caching. The code requires careful testing across environments and needs to handle various edge cases."
