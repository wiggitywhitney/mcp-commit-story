The user wants me to:

1. Fix the JSON formatting issues in tasks.json 
2. Remove the "dump" references from the task since they don't want that terminology
3. Keep the prompt research which was the main interest
4. Update task dependencies:
   - Task 51: No changes (currently has no dependencies)
   - Task 55: No changes (already depends on [51]) 
   - Task 50: Add dependency on Task 55, so it should depend on ["61", "55"] instead of just ["61"]

Let me start by fixing the JSON formatting issue

Perfect! This confirms what I suspected. The commit b71e3e1 captured a window of pure AI activity - no user messages at all. This makes sense because:

1. The commit was made 3 minutes ago
2. The session shows only AI processing: tool executions, AI thinking, and AI text responses
3. The user input that triggered this AI work likely happened earlier, possibly in a different session

This is actually a great discovery about how Cursor works:
- User inputs can be in one session

Yes, hardcoding Unix timestamps like `1640995200000` in tests is **terrible practice**. Here's what we've improved:

### ❌ Before (Bad):

start_timestamp = 1640995200000  # Magic number!

Interesting! The function is working correctly now (no crashes, proper paths detected), but it's not finding any messages. This could be because:

2. There might not be any Composer chat messages in that specific time window
3. The messages might be in a different format than expected

Let me try running it with a wider time window to see if we can capture some real chat data.
