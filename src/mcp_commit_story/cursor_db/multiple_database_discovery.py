"""
Multiple database discovery for Cursor chat databases.

This module handles discovery and extraction from multiple Cursor databases
to address the 100-generation limit that causes database rotation. When Cursor
reaches 100 generations in a chat session, it creates a new database file,
potentially leaving chat history scattered across multiple state.vscdb files.

Performance Optimization:
This module includes incremental processing optimization that filters databases
by modification time (48-hour window) to avoid re-processing unchanged databases
during frequent operations like journal generation and git hooks.

Background:
Cursor creates new database files after 100 generations to manage performance.
This results in multiple state.vscdb files in different subdirectories of the
.cursor folder. The single-database approach in query_cursor_chat_database()
only accesses the primary database, missing historical conversations.

Key Functions:
- discover_all_cursor_databases: Find all state.vscdb files in workspace
- extract_from_multiple_databases: Extract data from multiple databases
- get_recent_databases: Filter databases by 48-hour modification window

Performance Thresholds:
- discover_all_cursor_databases: 100ms (file system traversal)
- extract_from_multiple_databases: 500ms (multi-database processing)
- get_recent_databases: 10ms (file modification time checks)

Error Handling:
Both functions use graceful error handling with skip-and-continue patterns.
Individual database failures don't prevent processing of other databases.
Permission errors during discovery are logged but don't stop the search.

Telemetry:
Both functions are instrumented with @trace_mcp_operation for performance
monitoring and include attributes for database counts and error tracking.

Usage Example:
    >>> # Discover all databases in a workspace
    >>> databases = discover_all_cursor_databases("/path/to/workspace")
    >>> print(f"Found {len(databases)} databases")
    
    >>> # Extract data from all discovered databases
    >>> results = extract_from_multiple_databases(databases)
    >>> for result in results:
    ...     print(f"Database: {result['database_path']}")
    ...     print(f"Prompts: {len(result['prompts'])}")
    ...     print(f"Generations: {len(result['generations'])}")

Integration:
This module is designed to be used alongside the existing cursor_db functions:
- Use discover_all_cursor_databases() to find databases
- Use extract_from_multiple_databases() to get raw data
- Use Composer integration to provide chronological data directly

def get_recent_databases(all_databases: List[str], current_time: float = None) -> List[str]:
    """
    Filter databases to only include those modified within the last 48 hours.
    
    This optimization function addresses performance issues with frequent database
    processing (e.g., journal generation, git hooks) by only processing databases
    that have been modified recently. Uses a fixed 48-hour window based on file
    modification time to balance performance gains with completeness.
    
    48-Hour Window Rationale:
    - Captures active development sessions (typically 1-2 days)
    - Balances performance improvement vs. missing recent changes
    - Simple and predictable behavior for users
    - Handles edge cases like weekend work patterns
    
    Implementation Strategy:
    - Uses os.path.getmtime() for simplicity and compatibility
    - Graceful error handling for inaccessible files
    - In-memory only - no persistent caching or state
    - Stateless operation - same input always produces same output
    
    Performance Impact:
    - Expected 80-90% reduction in processing for mature projects
    - Sub-10ms filtering time for typical database counts
    - Significant improvement for extract_from_multiple_databases()
    
    Args:
        all_databases: List of absolute paths to database files, typically
                      from discover_all_cursor_databases()
        
    Returns:
        List of database paths that were modified within the last 48 hours.
        Returns empty list if input is empty or no databases are recent.
        Order is preserved from input list.
        
    Error Handling:
        - Gracefully skips databases that raise OSError during mtime check
        - Logs debug info for skipped databases but continues processing
        - Permission errors and missing files are handled silently
        
    Examples:
        >>> # Basic filtering
        >>> all_dbs = discover_all_cursor_databases("/workspace")
        >>> recent_dbs = get_recent_databases(all_dbs)
        >>> print(f"Processing {len(recent_dbs)} of {len(all_dbs)} databases")
        
        >>> # Use with extraction
        >>> recent_dbs = get_recent_databases(all_dbs)
        >>> if recent_dbs:
        ...     results = extract_from_multiple_databases(recent_dbs)
        ... else:
        ...     print("No recent database changes found")
        
        >>> # Check time savings
        >>> all_count = len(all_dbs)
        >>> recent_count = len(get_recent_databases(all_dbs))
        >>> savings = ((all_count - recent_count) / all_count) * 100
        >>> print(f"Performance improvement: {savings:.1f}% fewer databases")
