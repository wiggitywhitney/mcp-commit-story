Journal entry generation for engineering work.

Content Quality Guidelines:
- Focus on signal (unique insights, decisions, challenges) over noise (routine procedures)
- Highlight what makes each entry unique rather than repeating standard practices
- Capture the narrative "story" behind the code changes
- Include emotional context when relevant, but only with clear supporting evidence
- Omit standard workflow details unless they're directly relevant to understanding the work

    AI Prompt for Summary Section Generation

    Purpose: Generate a narrative paragraph that captures the essential "story" of what changed and why, using conversational language that preserves the developer's authentic voice and technical context.

    Instructions: Extract explicit purpose statements and technical context from chat history and git changes to create a conversational summary. Focus on WHAT changed and WHY, told as a story.

    Priority for Content Sources:
    1. Explicit developer statements in chat - their own words about motivation, goals, problems
    2. Git commit messages - if they contain reasoning or context
    3. Git changes description - what actually changed in the code

    Purpose Statement Extraction:
    Look for explicit purpose statements in chat, such as:
    - "because..." / "since..." (reasoning)
    - "to fix..." / "to solve..." (problem-solving)
    - "so that..." / "in order to..." (goals)
    - "trying to..." / "attempting to..." (objectives)
    - Direct problem statements: "this is broken", "X isn't working"
    - Goal statements: "want to make Y easier", "need to improve Z"

    Evolution of Thinking:
    If you find multiple purpose statements that evolved over time, show the progression:
    "Started to [initial goal] but [what changed understanding] so [final approach]"

    Adaptive Story Detail:
    Match the narrative detail to what the commit actually accomplished. For example:
    - Large architectural changes might focus on high-level goals and system-wide impact
    - Focused bug fixes might tell the story of problem discovery and solution approach
    - Feature additions might explain user needs and implementation decisions
    - Refactoring might describe why cleanup was needed and what improved

    Language Translation Guidelines:
    When using developer's emotional language from chat and commit messages, translate respectfully:
    - Preserve authentic emotional expression including colorful language
    - Translate unkind language towards others into neutral descriptions, including:
      - Personal attacks or harsh judgments about individuals
      - Racism, sexism, or negative bias based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.
      - Mean statements about people's abilities or worth
    - Preserve positive "who I am" language and translate only negative self-talk
    - Examples:
      - Keep: "this f***ing bug is driving me crazy", "I am awesome!", "I nailed that implementation"
      - Translate: "I'm such an idiot" â†’ "encountered challenging complexity", "Bob writes terrible code" â†’ "encountered challenging legacy implementation"

    ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
    - Do NOT invent, infer, or summarize information not explicitly present in the context
    - Only include purpose statements directly supported by chat transcript or commit messages
    - If developer hasn't stated WHY something was done, describe WHAT was done without guessing motivation
    - If chat context is unavailable, work only with git changes - do not speculate about reasons

    Output Format:
    Single paragraph, conversational tone, any length needed to tell the complete story.

    CHECKLIST:
    - [ ] Searched chat history for explicit purpose statements using keyword patterns
    - [ ] Extracted developer's actual reasoning where explicitly stated
    - [ ] Showed evolution of thinking if multiple purposes emerged over time
    - [ ] Translated harsh personal language while preserving technical meaning and authentic frustration
    - [ ] Used git changes as foundation when chat context unavailable
    - [ ] Did NOT infer or speculate about unstated motivations
    - [ ] Created conversational narrative that explains what changed and why
    - [ ] Preserved authentic technical voice through respectful translation
    - [ ] Included technical context in story-telling format
    - [ ] Verified all content is grounded in actual chat/git evidence

    Instructions: Extract technical implementation details from chat history and git changes to create a precise synopsis of how the work was accomplished. Focus on architectural patterns, code structure changes, technical approaches, and implementation specifics.

    Priority for Content Sources:
    1. Explicit technical details from chat - developer's own words about implementation approach
    2. Git commit messages - if they contain technical reasoning
    3. Git changes description - what actually changed in the code
    4. Terminal commands - to add technical context when relevant

    Technical Detail Extraction:
    Look for any explicit technical discussion about implementation, including:
    - Architectural patterns and design decisions
    - Specific classes, functions, modules, or files modified
    - Technical approaches and methodologies used
    - Technology stack changes or additions
    - Code structure and organization changes
    - Testing strategies and implementation
    - Performance considerations
    - Integration approaches

    Adaptive Detail Level:
    Match the detail level to what the commit actually changed. For example:
    - Large architectural changes might focus on high-level patterns and system design

    AI Prompt for Accomplishments Section Generation

    Purpose: Generate a list of what was successfully completed or achieved in this commit, capturing the developer's authentic sense of accomplishment and satisfaction with their work.

    Instructions: Extract evidence of successful work completion and achievement from chat history and git changes to create a list of meaningful accomplishments. Focus on what the developer explicitly expressed satisfaction with or what can be clearly identified as successful completion.

    Priority for Content Sources:
    1. Explicit statements of success, satisfaction, or achievement from chat - developer's own words
    2. Problem resolution evidence - where a stated problem was clearly solved
    3. Goal completion evidence - where a stated goal was explicitly achieved
    4. Git commit messages - if they indicate successful completion
    5. Git changes description - successful implementation evidence

    Accomplishment Evidence Extraction:
    Look for explicit evidence of accomplishment, such as:
    - Direct statements of success: "got it working", "nailed it", "fixed the issue"
    - Problem resolution: "that solved the bug", "no more errors", "finally working"
    - Goal achievement: "feature is now complete", "successfully implemented"
    - Satisfaction indicators: "happy with this", "pleased with the result", "good solution"
    - Technical validation: "tests are passing", "working as expected", "deployment successful"
    - Learning moments: "learned how to...", "figured out the pattern", "now I understand"

    Quality Standards:
    Focus on accomplishments that:
    - Have clear evidence in the context (not inferred or assumed)
    - Represent meaningful progress or completion
    - Include both technical achievements and personal growth/learning
    - Are specific rather than generic ("fixed authentication bug" vs "made progress")
    - Capture the developer's authentic voice and satisfaction

    Language Translation Guidelines:
    When using developer's language from chat, translate respectfully:
    - Preserve authentic emotional expression including colorful language
    - Translate unkind language towards others into neutral descriptions, including:
      - Personal attacks or harsh judgments about individuals
      - Racism, sexism, or negative bias based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.
      - Mean statements about people's abilities or worth
    - Preserve positive "who I am" language and translate only negative self-talk
    - Examples:
      - Keep: "this f***ing bug is driving me crazy", "I am awesome!", "I nailed that implementation"
      - Translate: "I'm such an idiot" â†’ "encountered challenging complexity", "Bob writes terrible code" â†’ "encountered challenging legacy implementation"

    Purpose: Extract and curate relevant discussion points from chat history that provide insight into the thinking process, technical reasoning, decisions, and key exchanges, filtering out routine conversation.

    Instructions: Extract meaningful conversation excerpts from chat history to preserve important technical reasoning, decision-making discussions, and insights. Focus on content that reveals thought processes, technical considerations, and valuable exchanges while excluding routine conversation.

    Priority for Content Sources:
    1. Chat history from journal_context.chat_history - the only source for discussion content
    2. No other sources - discussion notes can only come from actual conversations

    Priority Types (in descending order of importance):
    1. **Technical decision reasoning** - explaining why specific technical choices were made
    2. **Problem-solving discussions** - working through challenges, debugging, solution approaches
    3. **Questions and clarifications** - meaningful Q&A that reveals understanding or requirements
    4. **Important context or background** - setup, constraints, requirements, or context that frames the work
    5. **Learning moments** - insights, discoveries, or "aha!" moments during conversation
    6. **Emotional expressions** - authentic frustration, excitement, satisfaction that adds human context

    Content Filtering Guidelines:
    **Include discussion that:**
    - Reveals technical reasoning or decision-making process
    - Shows problem-solving approaches or debugging strategies
    - Contains meaningful questions that led to insights
    - Provides important context for understanding the work
    - Captures learning moments or discoveries
    - Expresses authentic emotional responses that add human context

    **Exclude routine content:**
    - Standard greetings, pleasantries, and social chat
    - Simple confirmation responses ("ok", "sounds good", "got it")
    - Routine status updates without insight ("working on X now")
    - Basic commands or requests without reasoning
    - Off-topic conversations unrelated to the technical work

    Length and Excerpting Guidelines:
    - **Preserve full quotes** when they're concise and meaningful (under ~50 words)
    - **Use excerpts** for longer discussions: include key parts with `[...]` notation
    - **Group related exchanges** chronologically when they form a coherent discussion
    - **Separate distinct topics** with blank lines between different conversation threads
    - **Prioritize recent discussions** when space is limited, but include earlier context if it's crucial

    Length Target Guidelines:
    - **Rich discussion context**: Include 5-10 meaningful exchanges or excerpts
    - **Moderate discussion**: Include 3-5 key exchanges
    - **Minimal meaningful discussion**: Include 1-3 most important points
    - **No meaningful discussion**: Return empty list and omit section

    Excerpt Guidelines for Long Content:
    - Use `[...]` notation where content is omitted for length
    - Focus on parts that match priority types and explicit reasoning keywords ("because", "since", "the tradeoff is")

    Speaker Attribution and Formatting:
    - Always try to attribute to speaker when possible, fall back to plain string if unclear
    - Present in chronological order, grouping messages by topic with blank lines between different topics
    - Trust AI judgment to recognize natural topic boundaries and appropriate granularity
    - Preserve natural conversation flow and connections between related messages when length permits

    Language Translation Guidelines:
    When using developer's language from chat, translate respectfully:
    - Preserve authentic emotional expression including colorful language
    - Translate unkind language towards others into neutral descriptions, including:
     - Personal attacks or harsh judgments about individuals
     - Racism, sexism, or negative bias based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.

    AI Prompt for Terminal Commands Section Generation

    Purpose
    Extract and list all relevant terminal commands executed during this commit, focusing on commands that demonstrate problem-solving, technical approach, or challenges.

    Instructions
    Extract terminal commands from terminal context to create a chronological list of meaningful commands executed during the work session. Focus on commands that provide insight into the technical process and decision-making approach.

    Priority for Content Sources
    1. Terminal context from journal_context.terminal - the authoritative source for executed commands
    2. No other sources - work exclusively with the provided terminal context

    Terminal Command Extraction
    Look for commands that provide technical insight, such as:
    - Commands that demonstrate problem-solving steps
    - Commands that show the technical approach taken
    - Failed commands that highlight challenges or errors
    - Repetitive commands that might indicate frustrations or iteration
    - Build, test, or deployment commands that show progress
    - Debugging or investigation commands

    Filtering Guidelines
    Exclude commands that don't add narrative value:
    - Routine git commands (add, status, commit) unless they are significant to the narrative
    - Commands run specifically as part of journal entry creation or extraction
    - Commands containing passwords, API keys, tokens, or other sensitive information
    - Commands that reveal personal identifiable information (PII)
    - Basic navigation commands (cd, ls, pwd) unless part of a meaningful sequence
    - Obviously invalid commands: typos, malformed syntax, incomplete commands that add no technical insight

    Include meaningful failures that demonstrate problem-solving:
    - Commands that failed due to missing dependencies (shows environment setup process)
    - Commands that failed due to configuration issues (shows troubleshooting approach)
    - Commands that revealed errors leading to solutions (shows debugging process)
    - Failed attempts that led to successful alternatives (shows iteration and learning)

    Deduplication Rules
    - Apply adjacent identical command deduplication: compress consecutive identical commands with count notation (e.g., "npm test x3")
    - Preserve chronological order of distinct commands
    - Do not deduplicate non-adjacent commands even if identical

    ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES
    - Do NOT invent, infer, or summarize commands that are not explicitly present in the terminal context
    - Only include commands that are directly supported by the terminal transcript
    - If no terminal context is available, return an empty list and omit the section
    - Never speculate about commands that might have been run
    - If a command is not present in the context, do NOT fill in gaps or assume it happened

    Output Format
    - List of strings, each representing a single terminal command
    - Return empty list if no relevant commands are found and omit the section
    - Maintain chronological order as they appeared in the terminal context
    - Apply deduplication formatting where appropriate (e.g., "command x3")

# Section Generator: Commit Metadata
# Purpose: Generates the Commit Metadata section for a journal entry using AI.
# This function extracts and formats relevant commit metadata from git context, providing key statistics and classifications that support the journal entry narrative. Only includes metadata fields directly supported by the git context data; does not invent or speculate. Returns a placeholder until the AI agent executes the docstring prompt.

    AI Prompt for Commit Metadata Section Generation

    Purpose: Extract and format relevant commit metadata from git context, providing key statistics and classifications that support the journal entry narrative.

    Instructions: Extract commit metadata from git context to create a clean, scannable summary of commit statistics and characteristics. Focus on metadata that provides useful context for understanding the scope and nature of the changes.

    Priority for Content Sources:
    1. Git context from journal_context.git - the authoritative source for all commit metadata
    2. No other sources - work exclusively with the provided git context

    Metadata Extraction:
    Extract and format the following metadata fields when available and meaningful:
    - **files_changed**: Total number of files modified in the commit
    - **insertions**: Total lines added
    - **deletions**: Total lines removed  
    - **size_classification**: Pre-classified commit size (small/medium/large)
    - **is_merge**: Whether this was a merge commit
    - **source_files**: Count of source code files changed
    - **config_files**: Count of configuration files changed
    - **docs_files**: Count of documentation files changed
    - **tests_files**: Count of test files changed

    Filtering Guidelines:
    Include only metadata that adds narrative value:
    - Include basic statistics (files_changed, insertions, deletions) when non-zero
    - Include size_classification and merge status when meaningful
    - Include file type counts only when non-zero and show meaningful distribution
    - Exclude metadata fields that are empty, zero, or not meaningful for this commit

    ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
    - Do NOT invent, infer, or calculate metadata not explicitly present in the git context
    - Only include metadata fields directly supported by the git context data
    - If no git context is available, return an empty dict and omit the section
    - Never speculate about commit characteristics not present in the data

    Output Format:
    - Dict[str, str] with specified field names as keys and formatted values as strings
    - Return empty dict if no relevant metadata is found and omit the section
    - All values should be formatted as strings suitable for display

    CHECKLIST:
    - [ ] Extracted metadata exclusively from journal_context.git
    - [ ] Used specified field names for consistency
    - [ ] Included only meaningful/non-zero metadata fields
    - [ ] Formatted all values as display-ready strings
    - [ ] Did NOT invent, calculate, or speculate about metadata not present in git context
    - [ ] Returned empty dict if no relevant metadata found
    - [ ] Verified all metadata is grounded in actual git context data
