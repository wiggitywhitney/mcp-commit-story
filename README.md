# MCP Commit Story: Your Engineering Journey, Remembered

## What is MCP Commit Story?

MCP Commit Story is a personal engineering journal for developers who want to capture not just what they built, but how it felt and why it mattered.  
It's a tool-in-progress, built by and for developers who care about the story behind the code.

MCP Commit Story runs as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, designed to work hand-in-hand with AI agents. These agents help gather and summarize the real context from your development workflow—so your journal entries are always grounded in what actually happened.

## Why Build This?

As a developer, it's easy to forget the "why" behind your work—what challenged you, what you learned, and how you grew.  
MCP Commit Story helps you:

- **Capture the narrative:** Each commit becomes a journal entry, recording not just the technical changes, but the decisions, frustrations, and small wins along the way.
- **Remember how it felt:** The journal includes mood and emotional context, so you can look back and see not just what you did, but how you experienced it.
- **Surface stories and insights:** By collecting real context from your workflow (AI Agent chat, terminal, code changes, commit messages), you can spot threads of challenge and triumph—perfect for blog posts, conference talks, or just understanding your own growth (no small thing!)
- **Support retrospectives and reviews:** Summaries and insights make it easier to reflect, ask for career advancement, or explain why certain choices were made.

## What Does a Day Look Like?

Here's an example daily summary, generated from real sample data:

```markdown
# 2025-05-20-daily.md

## Summary
Completed package rename from mcp_journal to mcp_commit_story, implemented journal entry generation with comprehensive TDD testing, and improved documentation quality. Resolved major duplication bug in journal file. Key milestone: project rebranding is complete and core journal functionality is operational.

## Key Accomplishments
- Successfully renamed entire package structure from mcp_journal to mcp_commit_story
- Implemented JournalEntry class with full test coverage (9/9 tests passing)
- Fixed major data integrity issue: removed 1,400+ duplicate entries from journal
- Updated all documentation, configuration, and CI/CD references
- Added content quality guidelines to engineering spec

## Challenges Overcome
- Tedious but critical package rename across multiple files and configs
- Subtle duplication problem required careful diagnosis and scripting to resolve
- Markdown formatting issue in engineering spec affecting GitHub rendering

## Technical Progress
- 9 commits made throughout the day
- Files changed: 50+ across multiple commits
- Test coverage: All tests passing (95/95)
- Major refactoring completed without breaking functionality

## Learning & Insights
- Package rename process made much easier with AI agent assistance
- Importance of data integrity validation in automated workflows
- TDD approach prevented issues during major structural changes

## Next Steps
- Continue with Task 5 implementation: file operations for journal management
- Implement MCP server operations
- Add CLI interface with Click framework

## Mood Indicators
Methodical and satisfied - complex refactoring completed successfully with no major blockers. Relieved to have data integrity issues resolved and project properly rebranded.
```

## How Does It Work?

- **Automatic context collection:** The MCP server works with AI agents to pull in commit messages, code changes, terminal commands, and AI chat history, building a rich, evidence-based journal entry.
- **Granular section generation:** Each section of the journal entry (summary, accomplishments, frustrations, tone, terminal, discussion, commit details) is generated by a dedicated function that uses all available context—git commit info, terminal activity, and AI chat discussion—ensuring every section is as complete and accurate as possible.
- **No hallucinated summaries:** Everything in your journal is grounded in real actions and conversations.
- **Mood and emotion:** The journal reflects your mood and tone based on how you talk to the AI agent or what you write in commit messages—so if you vent, celebrate, or reflect, those feelings are captured authentically.
- **Summaries and threads:** Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries help you spot patterns, track progress, and find the stories worth sharing.

## The Story in Action

Bonnie, a developer, used MCP Commit Story for several months. When her manager asked about a past architecture decision, she didn't have to rely on memory or dig through old tickets. Her journal had the exact discussion, the alternatives considered, and the rationale—complete with the commands and tests that backed it up.

Later, Bonnie used her journal to write a conference talk. She found not just the technical steps, but the frustrations, breakthroughs, and lessons learned along the way. Her talk resonated because it was grounded in real experience, not just a list of features.

Over time, Bonnie's journal became a resource for performance reviews, onboarding new teammates, and even her own career growth. The value wasn't in any single entry, but in the cumulative story of her engineering journey.

## Unobtrusive by Design: Works Silently in the Background

MCP Commit Story is triggered automatically by a Git hook with each commit. It works silently in the background, capturing context and generating journal entries—plus daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries—without disrupting your workflow. There's no need for manual intervention—just commit as usual, and your engineering story is recorded for you.

---

## Why Use It?

- **For yourself:**  
  - Remember why you made certain choices, and how you overcame obstacles.
  - See your growth as a developer, not just a list of commits.
  - Reflect on your work with more honesty and clarity.

- **For content creation:**  
  - Identify threads of challenge and triumph to turn into blog posts, talks, or portfolio pieces.
  - Capture the real story behind your technical journey—perfect for developer advocacy, teaching, or sharing with your future self.

- **For retrospectives and reviews:**  
  - Quickly find evidence of your impact, challenges, and decisions.
  - Make performance reviews, career advancement, or team retrospectives more meaningful and less stressful.

## Project Status

This project is under active development by a solo developer.  
The core journal engine, context collection, and summary generation are being built and tested with a TDD-first approach.  
Installation and CLI instructions will be added as the tool matures.

---

## Getting Started

MCP Commit Story is still in early development and not yet ready for general use. If you're interested in engineering storytelling, developer experience, or just want to follow the project's progress, feel free to watch the repo or open an issue with your thoughts, questions, or suggestions. Your feedback and curiosity are welcome as the project evolves!
