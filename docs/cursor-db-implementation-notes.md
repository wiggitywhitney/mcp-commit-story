This document contains technical research and implementation notes for the `cursor_db` package, particularly around optimization strategies and change detection methods.

## SQLite Change Detection Research

*Research conducted for database optimization implementation*

### Research Question
How should we optimize cursor database processing for incremental updates? What are the best methods for detecting SQLite database changes beyond simple file modification time?

### Key Findings

**File Modification Time Limitations:**
- Second-level granularity issues
- False positives from VACUUM operations  
- False negatives in networked/containerized environments
- No information about what changed

**Better Alternatives Evaluated:**
1. **Internal Version Tracking** - Database-level version tables with triggers
2. **WAL File Monitoring** - Watch write-ahead log changes
3. **Row-Level Timestamps** - Track changes at record level
4. **Change Log Tables** - Comprehensive audit trails
5. **Checksum-Based Detection** - Hash comparison approaches

### Database Optimization Implementation Decision

**Chosen Approach: File modification time with 48-hour window**

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity**: No database schema changes required
- **Read-only**: Cursor databases are external, we can't add triggers
- **Pragmatic**: Good enough for our specific use case (journal generation)
- **Performance**: Dramatic improvement over processing all databases
- **Low risk**: Worst case is processing slightly more data than needed

**48-Hour Window Logic:**
- Cursor chat sessions are typically daily/weekly
- 48 hours covers recent activity with margin for timezone differences
- Balances performance vs. completeness
- Stateless approach - no persistent tracking needed

## SQLite Database Change Detection Methods for Incremental Processing

### Understanding SQLite File Behavior During Modifications

#### Physical File Changes

When data is added, modified, or deleted in a SQLite database, the database file undergoes several physical changes:

1. **Journal Files**: SQLite typically creates temporary journal files (either a rollback journal or a write-ahead log) during write operations. These files help maintain ACID compliance and are created/modified before changes are committed to the main database file.

2. **File Size Changes**: The database file size often changes when records are added or when vacuuming occurs, but not necessarily for every update or delete operation due to SQLite's page-based storage architecture.

3. **Page Modifications**: SQLite stores data in fixed-size pages (typically 4KB). When data is modified, entire pages are rewritten, even if only a small portion of the page data changed.

4. **B-tree Structure Updates**: As the internal B-tree structures are modified to accommodate new or changed data, multiple pages may be affected beyond just the data pages containing the modified records.

5. **File Timestamp Updates**: The file modification time (mtime) of the database file is updated when changes are committed, but this happens at the filesystem level and is not controlled by SQLite itself.

#### Atomicity and Durability Considerations

SQLite ensures atomicity through its transaction mechanism:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- modifications
COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
```

During a transaction, changes are not immediately reflected in the main database file until the COMMIT occurs. This means that file modification time will only update at the end of a transaction, not during intermediate operations.

### Limitations of File Modification Time for Change Detection

Using file modification time (`mtime`) for detecting database changes has several significant limitations:

1. **Granularity Issues**: File modification time typically has second-level granularity on many filesystems, making it unsuitable for detecting rapid successive changes.

2. **False Positives**: Some operations might update the file timestamp without changing actual data (like opening the database in certain modes or running VACUUM).

3. **False Negatives**: Some filesystems or environments might not reliably update modification times, especially in networked or containerized environments.

4. **No Change Details**: The modification time provides no information about what changed, which tables were affected, or the scope of changes.

5. **Backup/Restore Issues**: When databases are backed up and restored, file timestamps may be preserved or reset, breaking change detection logic.

6. **Distributed Systems**: In distributed systems, file timestamps may not be synchronized across different nodes.

### Better Alternatives for Change Detection

#### 1. Internal Version Tracking

Implement a dedicated version tracking table within the database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
    version_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    version_number TEXT NOT NULL,
    applied_timestamp TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    description TEXT
);

-- Triggers to update version on changes
CREATE TRIGGER update_version_after_table1_change
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table1
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO schema_version (version_number, description)
    VALUES ((SELECT COALESCE(MAX(version_number), '0') FROM schema_version) + 1, 
            'Change in table1');
END;
```

This approach provides precise tracking of when and what changed, with transaction-level accuracy.

#### 2. SQLite's Built-in Change Tracking

SQLite provides several built-in mechanisms for change detection:

##### a. Update Hook API

In programming languages with SQLite bindings, you can register update hooks:

```python
def update_callback(operation_type, database, table, rowid):
    print(f"Operation {operation_type} on {database}.{table}, rowid={rowid}")

# Register the callback
connection.set_update_hook(update_callback)
```

##### b. Using `sqlite_sequence` Table

For tables with `AUTOINCREMENT`, you can monitor the `sqlite_sequence` table:

```sql
SELECT seq FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name='your_table';
```

An increased sequence number indicates new records were added.

##### c. Using the `count_changes` Pragma

```sql
PRAGMA count_changes = ON;
```

This makes modification statements return the number of rows affected.

#### 3. Row-Level Timestamp Columns

Add timestamp columns to track changes at the row level:

```sql
CREATE TABLE data (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    updated_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON data
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE data SET updated_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = NEW.id;
END;
```

This allows for precise tracking of which records changed and when.

#### 4. Change Logs Table

Implement a dedicated change log table that records all modifications:

```sql
CREATE TABLE change_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    operation TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
    record_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    changed_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    changed_by TEXT,
    old_values TEXT, -- JSON or serialized representation
    new_values TEXT  -- JSON or serialized representation
);

-- Example trigger for one table
CREATE TRIGGER log_changes_after_update
AFTER UPDATE ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO change_log (table_name, operation, record_id, old_values, new_values)
    VALUES ('your_table', 'UPDATE', NEW.id, 
            json_object('field1', OLD.field1, 'field2', OLD.field2),
            json_object('field1', NEW.field1, 'field2', NEW.field2));
END;
```

This provides a comprehensive audit trail of all changes.

#### 5. Using SQLite's Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

Enable WAL mode and monitor the WAL file:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
```

The WAL file contains all recent changes and can be monitored for modifications. You can check its existence, size, or content changes to detect database modifications.

#### 6. Checksum-Based Approaches

Calculate and store checksums of critical tables or the entire database:

```sql
-- Pseudo-SQL (implementation depends on language/environment)
SELECT md5(group_concat(id || content || updated_at)) FROM your_table;
```

Compare the current checksum with the previously stored value to detect changes.

### Implementing Incremental Processing with Change Detection

For efficient incremental processing, combine multiple approaches:

#### 1. High-Level Change Detection

Use a version table with a single incrementing counter that updates on any database change:

```sql
CREATE TABLE db_version (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1), -- Ensure only one row
    version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    last_updated TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

-- Initialize with a single row
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO db_version (id) VALUES (1);

-- Update version in triggers
CREATE TRIGGER increment_version_after_table1_change
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table1
BEGIN
    UPDATE db_version SET 
        version = version + 1,
        last_updated = datetime('now')
    WHERE id = 1;
END;
```

#### 2. Table-Level Change Tracking

For each table that requires incremental processing, add a last_modified timestamp:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_changes (
    table_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    last_modified TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    record_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Update via triggers
CREATE TRIGGER track_table1_changes
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table1
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO table_changes (table_name, last_modified, record_count)
    VALUES ('table1', datetime('now'), (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1))
    ON CONFLICT(table_name) DO UPDATE SET
        last_modified = datetime('now'),
        record_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1);
END;
```

#### 3. Incremental Processing Implementation

```python
def process_incremental_changes(db_connection):
    # Get current database version
    current_version = db_connection.execute(
        "SELECT version FROM db_version WHERE id = 1").fetchone()[0]
    
    # Check if we need to process changes
    if current_version <= last_processed_version:
        return False  # No changes
    
    # Get tables that changed
    changed_tables = db_connection.execute("""
        SELECT table_name, last_modified 
        FROM table_changes 
        WHERE last_modified > ?
    """, (last_processed_timestamp,)).fetchall()
    
    # Process each changed table
    for table_name, last_modified in changed_tables:
        if table_name == 'table1':
            process_table1_changes(db_connection, last_processed_timestamp)
        elif table_name == 'table2':
            process_table2_changes(db_connection, last_processed_timestamp)
    
    # Update last processed version
    last_processed_version = current_version
    last_processed_timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
    
    return True  # Changes processed
```

### Performance Considerations

When implementing change detection for incremental processing, consider these performance aspects:

1. **Trigger Overhead**: Extensive use of triggers for change tracking adds overhead to write operations. Consider batching updates to the tracking tables.

2. **Index Usage**: Ensure proper indexing on timestamp columns used for incremental queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_data_updated_at ON data(updated_at);
```

3. **Selective Processing**: Process only the changed records rather than entire tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE updated_at > ?
```

4. **Transaction Grouping**: Group related change tracking operations in transactions to minimize overhead.

5. **Periodic Cleanup**: Implement cleanup routines for change logs and version history to prevent unbounded growth.

### Conclusion

While file modification time provides a simple mechanism for detecting database changes, it has significant limitations for reliable incremental processing. Internal version tracking, dedicated change log tables, and row-level timestamps offer more robust alternatives that provide greater precision and reliability.

For mission-critical applications requiring accurate incremental processing, a combination of database-level version tracking and table-specific change logs provides the most comprehensive solution, ensuring that all changes are properly detected and processed.

For our specific cursor_db use case, the file modification time approach with a 48-hour window provides an optimal balance of simplicity and performance improvement.
