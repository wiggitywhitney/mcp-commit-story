# MCP Commit Story - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

MCP Commit Story is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that automatically generates comprehensive journal entries from git commits and AI chat history. It bridges the gap between technical development activities and meaningful personal reflection by creating rich, contextual journal entries that capture both the technical work and the thought processes behind it.

## Core Value Proposition

**Transform development commits into meaningful personal narratives** by combining git metadata with AI chat conversations to create journal entries that capture not just what was built, but why, how, and what was learned in the process.

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Software developers who use AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and want to maintain development journals
- **Secondary**: Engineering teams wanting to capture institutional knowledge and decision-making processes
- **Tertiary**: Researchers studying AI-assisted development workflows

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Journal Generation
