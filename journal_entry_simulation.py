    # Technical Synopsis - detailed implementation
    technical_synopsis = """**TDD Implementation Process:**
- Created comprehensive test file `test_cursor_db_telemetry.py` with 19 test classes covering all telemetry scenarios
- Implemented failing tests first, then added telemetry instrumentation to make them pass
- Verified decorator application, performance metrics, error handling, and integration workflows
- Fixed mock setup issues and test expectations to achieve 100% test pass rate

**Telemetry Instrumentation:**
- Added @trace_mcp_operation decorators to all 4 cursor_db public functions:
  - `execute_cursor_query` → "cursor_db.execute_query" 
  - `extract_prompts_data` → "cursor_db.extract_prompts"
  - `extract_generations_data` → "cursor_db.extract_generations"
  - `reconstruct_chat_history` → "cursor_db.reconstruct_chat"
- Implemented OpenTelemetry span tracking with comprehensive attributes

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Added cursor_db thresholds to PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS in telemetry.py:
  - execute_cursor_query: 50ms (basic SQLite operations)
  - extract_prompts_data: 100ms (query + JSON parsing ~100 entries)
  - extract_generations_data: 100ms (query + JSON parsing ~100 entries)
  - reconstruct_chat_history: 200ms (processing + sorting ~200 messages)

**Telemetry Attributes:**
- database_path, prompt_count, generation_count, total_messages
- truncation_detected, json_parse_errors, malformed_prompts, malformed_generations
- query_duration_ms, threshold_exceeded, threshold_ms
- Error categorization: error.type, error.category, error.message

**Documentation Updates:**
- Enhanced module docstrings explaining telemetry instrumentation approach
- Updated function docstrings with detailed telemetry metrics sections
- Added comments explaining threshold rationale and performance considerations
- Documented metrics tracked, threshold reasoning, and implementation patterns

**Quality Assurance:**
- Full test suite: 916/938 tests passing (916 passed, 1 skipped, 22 xfailed)
- Zero regressions: All existing cursor_db functionality preserved (47/47 core tests passing)
- Comprehensive telemetry test coverage: 19/19 telemetry tests passing
- Error handling verification for database access vs query syntax issues

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mcp_commit_story/telemetry.py`: Added cursor_db performance thresholds
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/query_executor.py`: Added telemetry instrumentation
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/message_extraction.py`: Added telemetry to both extract functions
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/message_reconstruction.py`: Added telemetry to reconstruct function
- `tests/unit/test_cursor_db_telemetry.py`: New comprehensive test suite (524 lines)
- `tasks/task_046.txt`: Updated with implementation progress
- `tasks/tasks.json`: Marked Task 46.4 as complete

**Implementation Results:** Successfully established comprehensive observability for cursor_db operations with performance monitoring, data quality tracking, and error categorization while maintaining full backward compatibility"""
