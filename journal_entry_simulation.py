- Identified critical inefficiency in current cursor_db database processing approach
- Current implementation extracts ALL data from ALL databases on every function call
- Discovered filesystem metadata (os.path.getmtime()) is available for incremental processing
- Validated that optimization can be implemented without architectural changes

**Task 46.9 Creation - Incremental Database Processing:**
- Added comprehensive subtask for database modification time tracking optimization
- Implementation plan includes database metadata tracking, incremental extraction, optional caching
- Performance benefits: Significant reduction in processing time for repeated queries
- Strategic timing: Perfect follow-up to completed Task 46.7 (Multiple Database Discovery)

**Reflection Documentation:**
- Added 11:04 AM reflection to journal documenting the insight and strategic approach
- Used reflection_core.py functionality for proper formatting and telemetry
- Preserved the optimization opportunity for future implementation
- Documented the discovery process and validation of available filesystem metadata

**Implementation Plan Components:**
- Database metadata tracking with modification times and file sizes
- Incremental extraction logic to process only changed databases
- Optional caching system for frequently accessed data
- Performance benchmarking to validate optimization effectiveness

**Files Modified:**
- `sandbox-journal/daily/2025-06-26-journal.md`: Added reflection documenting optimization insight
- `tasks/task_046.txt`: Added Task 46.9 with comprehensive implementation plan (81 new lines)
- `tasks/tasks.json`: Created new subtask for incremental database processing

**Implementation Results:** Successfully preserved critical performance optimization insight with detailed implementation plan and reflection documentation for future development work"""
