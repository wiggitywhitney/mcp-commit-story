    # Technical Synopsis - detailed implementation
    technical_synopsis = """**Core Implementation:**
- Created `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/message_reconstruction.py` with reconstruct_chat_history() function
- Applied finalized design choices: simple dict format without pairing logic, clean metadata with counts only
- Implemented graceful malformed data handling with logging for missing required fields
- Function signature: `reconstruct_chat_history(prompts: List[Dict], generations: List[Dict]) -> Dict`
- Return format: `{"messages": [...], "metadata": {"prompt_count": N, "generation_count": M}}`

**Design Decisions:**
- No chronological pairing logic due to user prompts lacking timestamps
- Preservation of extraction order (prompts first, then generations) without timestamp sorting  
- Simple message format: `{role, content, timestamp, type}` with None values for prompts
- Content mapping: prompt['text'] ‚Üí content, generation['textDescription'] ‚Üí content
- Programmatic function delegates conversation interpretation to downstream AI processing

**Test-Driven Development:**
- Created comprehensive test suite with 16 test cases in `tests/unit/test_message_reconstruction.py`
- Tests cover: empty data, prompts only, generations only, mixed data, format validation
- Verified no pairing logic, extraction order preservation, and malformed data resilience
- All tests pass validating correct implementation of design specifications

**Package Integration:**
- Added reconstruct_chat_history to cursor_db package exports in `__init__.py`
- Function builds upon Task 46.2's extraction functions for complete message pipeline
- Architecture supports future Task 46.7 multi-database discovery without complex merging

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/message_reconstruction.py`: New message reconstruction module (76 lines)
- `tests/unit/test_message_reconstruction.py`: Comprehensive TDD test suite (435 lines)  
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/__init__.py`: Added function export (4 line change)
- `tasks/task_046.txt`: Updated with completion details (154 additional lines)
- `tasks/tasks.json`: Updated task 46.3 status to complete (17 line change)

**Test Results:** All 16 new tests pass + full test suite passes with no regressions"""
