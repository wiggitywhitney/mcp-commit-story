    # Technical Synopsis - detailed implementation
    technical_synopsis = """**Task Planning and Documentation Process:**
- Received detailed implementation plan for Task 46.7 - Handle Multiple Database Discovery
- Documented complete TDD workflow with step-by-step implementation approach
- Established approved design choices for database discovery and extraction functions
- Created comprehensive TaskMaster documentation for future implementation

**Problem Context - Database Rotation Handling:**
- Addresses Cursor's 100-generation limit that triggers database rotation
- Current implementation only handles single databases, missing rotated database history
- Need to discover and extract from ALL state.vscdb files in workspace
- Solution: recursive search and multi-database extraction without chronological merging

**Approved Function Signatures:**
- `discover_all_cursor_databases(workspace_path: str) -> List[str]`: Recursive search for all state.vscdb files
- `extract_from_multiple_databases(database_paths: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`: Extract from multiple databases
- Return structure: List of dicts with database_path, prompts, and generations for each database

**Search Strategy Design:**
- Start at workspace_path/.cursor/ directory
- Recursively search ALL subdirectories with no depth limit (keep it simple)
- Look for files named exactly 'state.vscdb'
- Skip permission errors and continue searching other directories
- Return absolute paths to all discovered database files

**Error Handling Approach:**
- Log warnings for inaccessible directories but continue processing
- Skip corrupted/locked databases without failing entire operation
- Return partial results from successful databases
- Empty list if no databases found (graceful degradation)

**Telemetry Specifications:**
- Add @trace_mcp_operation decorators to both functions
- Performance thresholds: discover_all_cursor_databases (100ms), extract_from_multiple_databases (500ms)
- Telemetry attributes: databases_discovered, databases_processed, search_duration_ms, extraction_duration_ms, errors_encountered

**Implementation Plan Structure:**
- TDD workflow: Write tests first → Verify failures → Implement → Verify passes
- Create new module: `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/multiple_database_discovery.py`
- Reuse existing Task 46.2 functions: extract_prompts_data() and extract_generations_data()
- Add comprehensive error handling with skip-and-continue pattern

**Key Design Principles:**
- Keep it simple, no over-engineering
- Just find all state.vscdb files and extract from each one
- No chronological merging attempted (missing prompt timestamps)
- Return fragmented data and let consumers handle multiple database results

**Documentation Scope:**
- Add docstrings explaining database rotation scenario
- Document that no chronological merging is attempted
- Note this addresses Cursor's 100-generation limit
- Focus on comprehensive error handling documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `tasks/task_046.txt`: Added complete Task 46.7 implementation plan with TDD workflow
- `tasks/tasks.json`: Updated task structure with detailed planning documentation

**Planning Results:** Successfully documented comprehensive implementation plan for multiple database discovery with approved design choices, TDD workflow, and focus on simplicity and robust error handling"""
