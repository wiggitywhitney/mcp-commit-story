## Summary
Focused on foundational architecture and reliability improvements for the engineering journal MCP server. The day was dedicated to formalizing context collection data structures, consolidating git data collection, and ensuring robust, portable test coverage. All work followed strict TDD and type safety principles, with careful attention to documentation and anti-hallucination requirements.

## Key Accomplishments
- Marked Task 5.11 (Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures) as in progress and logged a detailed implementation plan
- Refactored `collect_chat_history` and `collect_ai_terminal_commands` to use message-based boundaries, eliminating time-based logic
- Updated engineering spec and PRD to clarify message-based context collection and anti-hallucination rules
- Consolidated git data collection into a single `collect_git_context` function, replacing mock functions and improving maintainability
- Implemented and tested `collect_git_context` with robust handling for initial commits and file type classification
- Refactored all tests to use temporary git repos and explicit commit hashes, ensuring reliability in all environments (including CI)
- Updated all context collection and integration points to use the new unified structure
- Maintained alignment between code, documentation, and Taskmaster task tracking

## Challenges Overcome
- Addressed issues with GitPython's diff API for initial commits by using the canonical NULL_TREE approach
- Resolved test failures due to repo context mismatches by passing explicit repo and commit references
- Ensured test isolation and reliability by creating temporary repos and commits for all git-dependent tests
- Navigated feedback and iteration on docstring prompts to preserve user-authored content while clarifying new requirements

## Technical Progress
- 5 commits made throughout the day
- Files changed: context_types.py, journal.py, git_utils.py, engineering-mcp-journal-spec-final.md, scripts/mcp-commit-story-prd.md, test_journal.py, test_git_utils.py, test_context_collection.py, tasks.json, task_005.txt
- Test coverage: All context collection and integration tests passing in local and CI environments
- Major architectural improvements to context collection and git integration

## Learning & Insights
- TDD and type safety are critical for maintainability and reliability in context-driven systems
- Message-based boundaries are more robust than time-based logic for AI context collection
- Canonical git approaches (e.g., NULL_TREE) prevent edge case bugs in diff analysis
- Test isolation and explicit context setup are essential for CI reliability

## Mood & Tone Patterns
Overall mood: Satisfied, methodical, and confident
Notable progression: Started with foundational planning, moved through iterative refactoring and testing, and ended with robust, reliable test coverage and architectural clarity
Emotional arc: Minor frustrations with test failures, but resolved quickly with best-practice solutions

## Decision Points
- Chose to formalize all context collection data structures before implementing section generators
- Opted for message-based context boundaries and explicit anti-hallucination rules
- Consolidated git data collection for maintainability and narrative fidelity
- Prioritized test reliability and CI compatibility in all refactors
