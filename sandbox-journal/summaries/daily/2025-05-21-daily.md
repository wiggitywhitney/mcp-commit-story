## Summary
Made significant progress on the journal system's core infrastructure, implementing file operations, context collection, and formatting improvements. Reorganized project structure for clarity and rewrote the README to better communicate the vision. Key milestone: the foundational layers for reliable journal entry generation are now in place.

## Key Accomplishments
- Implemented comprehensive file operations with full TDD coverage (get_journal_file_path, create_journal_directories, append_to_journal_file)
- Added AI-powered context collection functions with anti-hallucination safeguards
- Enhanced journal entry formatting with proper header hierarchy, spacing, and code blocks
- Reorganized project structure by moving samples to sandbox-journal directory
- Completely rewrote README to be more engaging and narrative-focused

## Challenges Overcome
- Balanced simplicity with extensibility in file operation design
- Refined formatting rules and test logic for markdown conventions
- Navigated uncertainty about AI mood inference and explicit indicator requirements
- Integrated anti-hallucination rules into AI prompts for reliable context extraction

## Technical Progress
- 6 commits made throughout the day
- Files changed: 19 total across all commits
- Test coverage: All file operations and context collection tests passing
- Major infrastructure components now ready for integration

## Learning & Insights
- TDD approach continues to prevent issues during rapid development
- Project structure clarity becomes more important as complexity grows
- Documentation tone significantly impacts how people perceive and engage with the project
- Anti-hallucination rules are critical for maintaining journal entry integrity

## Process Improvements
- Added manual reflection capability with timestamping
- Clarified distinction between experimental and production journal entries
- Established clearer guidelines for mood/tone inference based on explicit indicators

## Next Steps
- Continue with section generation and integration work
- Implement MCP server operations and CLI interface
- Monitor AI mood inference behavior for future refinements

## Mood Indicators
Productive and systematic - steady progress on core infrastructure with good balance of implementation and documentation. Thoughtful about process improvements and maintaining quality standards while moving quickly.
