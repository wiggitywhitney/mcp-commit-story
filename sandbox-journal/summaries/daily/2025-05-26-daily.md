## 2025-05-26 â€” Daily Summary

### Summary
A comprehensive day focused on building the complete MCP server infrastructure and git automation foundation for the journal system. Major milestones included implementing all core MCP operations, creating robust journal initialization logic, and establishing fully automated git hook integration. The development process maintained strict TDD discipline throughout, resulting in a production-ready foundation with extensive test coverage and comprehensive documentation.

### Key Accomplishments
- Implemented complete MCP server core with dynamic version loading, configuration management, and error handling
- Built all essential MCP operation handlers (journal/new-entry, journal/add-reflection, journal/init, journal/install-hook)
- Created comprehensive journal initialization system with directory creation, config generation, and git validation
- Implemented robust git hook automation with portable script generation, backup logic, and automated installation
- Established CLI interface with standardized JSON output contracts and error codes
- Maintained strict TDD throughout with over 95% test coverage across unit and integration tests
- Updated all documentation, PRD, and engineering specs to reflect new capabilities

### Challenges Overcome
- Adapted to FastMCP limitations by implementing config/telemetry setup before server instantiation
- Resolved complex test isolation issues for git hook execution verification
- Navigated Python import path complexities in test suite due to src/ layout
- Managed coordination across multiple files and documentation to maintain consistency
- Addressed platform-specific permission handling for git repository operations

### Technical Progress
- 25+ commits made throughout the day spanning early morning to evening
- Files changed: 100+ across all commits with major additions to server infrastructure
- Test coverage: All tests passing with comprehensive unit and integration coverage
- Major architectural milestone: Complete MCP server ready for journal operations
- Git automation: Fully functional post-commit hook system with backup and recovery

### Learning & Insights
- Strict TDD discipline prevents regressions during rapid, complex development
- Comprehensive documentation and planning pays dividends when coordinating multiple system components
- Integration testing is critical for validating real-world behavior beyond unit test coverage
- Hot config reload and robust error handling improve developer experience significantly
- Automated git integration requires careful attention to portability and non-blocking behavior

### Mood & Tone Patterns
Overall mood: Determined, methodical, and increasingly satisfied
Notable progression: Started with foundational server work, progressed through systematic feature implementation, and ended with confident validation of complete automation workflow
Emotional arc: Some friction with test complexity and coordination requirements, but resolved through disciplined problem-solving and comprehensive validation

### Decision Points
- Chose to implement hot config reload for improved developer experience
- Opted for always-backup approach for git hook installation to ensure safety
- Prioritized JSON output contracts for CLI commands to support scripting and automation
- Added comprehensive integration testing to validate real-world git hook execution
- Updated Cursor rules to reduce approval friction and improve development velocity
