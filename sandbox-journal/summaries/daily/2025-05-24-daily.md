## Summary
A milestone day focused on formalizing the unified context model, implementing and testing all section generator scaffolds, and advancing the engineering journal MCP server's type safety and TDD rigor. The team completed foundational work on TypedDicts, section generator stubs, and comprehensive test fixtures, ensuring robust anti-hallucination compliance and future maintainability. All progress was meticulously tracked, with documentation, tests, and code kept in sync.

## Key Accomplishments
- Defined and documented TypedDicts for all context and section generator outputs (chat, terminal, git, journal, and all journal sections)
- Updated all context collection functions and downstream code to use the new types
- Implemented canonical AI-driven stubs for all section generators, each with a detailed, user-approved prompt and placeholder return
- Created comprehensive test fixtures and mock data for all section generators, covering edge cases and ensuring robust TDD
- Refactored journal entry structure to new canonical section order and renamed "Behind the Commit" to "Commit Metadata" throughout the codebase
- Updated engineering spec, PRD, and README to reflect the new unified context model and section order
- Added robust filtering of journal files to `collect_git_context` to prevent recursion and contamination
- Ensured all local/dev tests pass and AI/content tests are xfail as expected
- Maintained strict alignment between code, documentation, and Taskmaster task tracking

## Challenges Overcome
- Required careful coordination across code, tests, documentation, and task files to ensure consistency
- Addressed friction updating all references to renamed sections and new order
- Resolved test setup issues for git context filtering by ensuring all test files are created within the repo directory
- Managed complexity in scaffolding and testing all section generators in a single day

## Technical Progress
- 7+ commits made throughout the day
- Files changed: context_types.py, journal.py, git_utils.py, engineering-mcp-journal-spec-final.md, scripts/mcp-commit-story-prd.md, test_journal.py, test_journal_entry.py, test_git_utils.py, test_context_collection.py, summary_test_data.py, tasks.json, task_005.txt, README.md
- Test coverage: All structure, compliance, and placeholder tests passing; AI/content tests xfail as expected
- Major architectural improvements to section generator scaffolding, context model, and anti-hallucination safeguards

## Learning & Insights
- Canonical AI-driven function pattern (prompt in docstring, placeholder return) streamlines TDD and future AI integration
- Unified context model and strict type safety reduce errors and improve maintainability
- Comprehensive test fixtures and mock data are essential for robust, edge-case-driven TDD
- Filtering journal files from git context is critical for recursion prevention and narrative fidelity

## Mood & Tone Patterns
Overall mood: Thorough, systematic, and satisfied
Notable progression: Moved from foundational type/model work to broad implementation and test scaffolding, ending with robust, maintainable architecture
Emotional arc: Some friction with coordination and test setup, but resolved with methodical, best-practice solutions

## Decision Points
- Chose to formalize all context and section generator types before implementing content logic
- Opted for a unified context model and canonical section order for all journal entries
- Prioritized anti-hallucination compliance and test-driven development in all new code
- Added robust filtering to git context collection to prevent recursion
