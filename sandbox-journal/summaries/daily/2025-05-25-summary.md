## 2025-05-25 â€” Daily Summary

### Summary
- Major progress was made on the core journal entry generation pipeline, with all canonical section generators (tone/mood, discussion notes, terminal commands, commit metadata) implemented and tested.
- The context collection logic was refactored into a dedicated module, improving modularity and future extensibility.
- The test suite was rigorously expanded and cleaned up, achieving full coverage for all section types, error handling, and integration scenarios.
- Taskmaster dependencies and priorities were updated to clarify the MVP critical path, and new subtasks were added for post-commit automation.
- The codebase underwent several rounds of cleanup and refactoring, resulting in a leaner, more maintainable, and robust foundation for future development.

### Technical Synopsis
- Implemented and tested all major journal section generators in `journal.py`, each with strict anti-hallucination and formatting rules.
- Extracted all context collection functions to `context_collection.py`, updating all references and tests.
- Added and expanded tests for all section TypedDicts, integration, and error handling.
- Refactored and cleaned up the test suite, removing obsolete cases and ensuring all tests pass or are properly xfail/xpass.
- Updated Taskmaster task files and documentation to reflect new dependencies, priorities, and acceptance criteria for summary weighting.

### Accomplishments
- Canonicalized the journal entry pipeline with robust, test-driven section generators.
- Achieved full test coverage for all context types, section generators, and integration scenarios.
- Improved codebase modularity and maintainability through targeted refactoring.
- Clarified MVP priorities and critical path in Taskmaster.
- Maintained a green test suite throughout all major changes.

### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Some frustration with Python's lack of runtime TypedDict enforcement, requiring careful test design.
- Integration and normalization of new section generators surfaced subtle edge cases, especially in tone/mood handling.
- The majority of context extraction logic remains as AI-prompt-driven placeholders, pending future implementation.

### Tone/Mood
> Methodical, focused, and confident  
> The day was marked by steady, detail-oriented progress, with a sense of satisfaction in achieving a robust and extensible foundation.
