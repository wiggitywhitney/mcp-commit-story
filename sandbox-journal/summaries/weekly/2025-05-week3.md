# 2025-05-week3 — Weekly Summary (May 19–25, 2025)

## Summary
This week marked a major leap in the MCP engineering journal system, with the team moving from foundational infrastructure to a robust, test-driven, and extensible architecture. The core journal entry pipeline was fully implemented, all canonical section generators were scaffolded and tested, and the context collection logic was refactored for modularity. The project underwent significant refactoring, documentation, and planning improvements, culminating in a green test suite and clarified MVP priorities.

## Technical Synopsis
- Implemented and tested all major journal section generators in `journal.py` with strict anti-hallucination and formatting rules.
- Extracted and unified context collection logic into `context_collection.py`, updating all references and tests.
- Defined and documented TypedDicts for all context and section generator outputs, enforcing type safety and maintainability.
- Refactored the test suite for full coverage, removing obsolete cases and ensuring all tests pass or are properly xfail/xpass.
- Updated engineering spec, PRD, and README to reflect the new unified context model, section order, and anti-hallucination safeguards.
- Consolidated git data collection and improved test reliability with temporary repos and explicit commit hashes.

## Accomplishments
- Achieved full test coverage for all context types, section generators, and integration scenarios.
- Canonicalized the journal entry pipeline with robust, test-driven section generators.
- Improved codebase modularity and maintainability through targeted refactoring.
- Clarified MVP priorities and critical path in Taskmaster, adding new subtasks for post-commit automation.
- Maintained a green test suite throughout all major changes.
- Completed a major package rename and resolved a large-scale data duplication bug.

## Challenges / Frustrations
- Frustration with Python's lack of runtime TypedDict enforcement, requiring careful test design.
- Integration and normalization of new section generators surfaced subtle edge cases, especially in tone/mood handling.
- Test setup issues for git context filtering and context extraction required methodical debugging and best-practice solutions.
- The majority of context extraction logic remains as AI-prompt-driven placeholders, pending future implementation.

## Mood / Tone
> Methodical, focused, and confident. The week was marked by steady, detail-oriented progress, with a sense of satisfaction in achieving a robust and extensible foundation. Team sentiment was positive, with minor friction resolved through systematic approaches.

## Decision Points
- Chose to formalize all context and section generator types before implementing content logic.
- Opted for a unified context model and canonical section order for all journal entries.
- Prioritized anti-hallucination compliance and test-driven development in all new code.
- Decided to document GitPython binary file detection limitations and normalize input for journal entry parsing.
- Added robust filtering to git context collection to prevent recursion.

## Metrics
- Number of commits: 40+ (across all days)
- Files changed: 100+ (including major refactors and documentation updates)
- Test coverage: All implemented functionality has corresponding tests; all structure, compliance, and placeholder tests passing; AI/content tests xfail as expected
- Major refactors: context collection, section generators, test suite, and documentation
