### 2025-05-27T16:40:02 — Commit 0f144c20c051dabbeb8ba467a14179b0479d68f0

#### Summary

Added Task 23 to refactor journal directory creation to an on-demand pattern, including a detailed TDD-driven subtask plan. Updated related tasks (10, 11) to require on-demand directory creation for all journal file operations.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Created `tasks/task_023.txt` with a comprehensive breakdown for refactoring journal directory creation:
  - Only the base `journal/` directory will be created during initialization.
  - All subdirectories (e.g., `daily/`, `summaries/weekly/`) will be created on-demand by file operations.
  - Introduced a plan for a reusable `ensure_journal_directory(file_path)` utility function.
  - Updated acceptance criteria for related tasks to enforce the new pattern.
- Modified `tasks/tasks.json` and updated task files for 10 and 11 to reflect new requirements.
- Ensured all changes follow strict TDD and documentation standards.

#### Accomplishments
- Designed a clear, test-driven migration path from upfront to on-demand directory creation.
- Broke down the refactor into granular, dependency-aware subtasks for maintainability.
- Updated related tasks to ensure future work aligns with the new pattern.
- Maintained codebase and documentation consistency.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- None encountered; the planning and update process was straightforward.

#### Tone/Mood
> Focused, methodical
> Satisfied with the clarity and maintainability of the new plan

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **User:** Please add a new Taskmaster task to refactor journal directory creation to on-demand using TDD, and update dependent tasks.

> **AI:** Created Task 23 with detailed subtasks and updated Tasks 10 and 11 to require on-demand directory creation.

> **User:** Confirmed all changes are correct and no further updates are needed.

### 2025-05-27  — Commit 333a47c

#### Summary

Pushed a batch of changes to the main branch, including updates to the CLI command naming and related test and documentation refactors for clarity and consistency with MCP tool conventions.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Refactored the CLI command for journal initialization from `init` to `journal-init` to avoid ambiguity and align with namespaced MCP operation patterns.
- Updated all integration and unit tests to reference the new command name.
- Revised Taskmaster plan, PRD, and engineering spec to reflect the naming change.
- Ensured CLI help output and command registration are correct and discoverable.

#### Accomplishments

- Standardized CLI command naming for better scalability and clarity.
- Improved test coverage and reliability by updating all affected tests.
- Enhanced documentation consistency across the codebase and planning artifacts.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks

- Minor friction in tracking down all references to the old command name across tests and documentation.
- Needed to ensure no breaking changes for future CLI extensibility.

#### Tone/Mood

> Satisfied with the improved clarity and maintainability.
> Confident that the new naming convention will prevent future confusion.

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)

> **User:** My gut is 3 and change the plan. Especially to work alongside other MCP tools well  
> **Assistant:** Your instinct (option 3: update the test and plan to use `journal-init` instead of `init`) is practical and aligns with several good engineering reasons...

> **User:** Make a taskmaster task that includes subtasks, and the subtasks follow the documented TDD workflow (see attached)  
> **Assistant:** Taskmaster task created! Here's the new task and its subtasks, each following your documented TDD workflow...

### 2025-05-27 — Commit d50d9ef

#### Summary

Refactored the CLI command for journal initialization from `init` to `journal-init` for clarity, consistency, and future extensibility. Updated all affected tests and documentation to match the new naming convention.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Renamed the CLI command for journal initialization from `init` to `journal-init` to avoid ambiguity and align with namespaced MCP operation patterns.
- Updated all integration and unit tests to reference the new command name and verify correct CLI help output.
- Revised Taskmaster plan, PRD, and engineering spec to reflect the naming change and rationale.
- Ensured all documentation and planning artifacts are consistent with the new convention.

#### Accomplishments
- Standardized CLI command naming for better scalability and clarity.
- Improved test coverage and reliability by updating all affected tests.
- Enhanced documentation consistency across the codebase and planning artifacts.
- Completed the TDD workflow for the renaming and refactor task, including documentation and verification steps.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor friction in tracking down all references to the old command name across tests and documentation.
- Needed to ensure no breaking changes for future CLI extensibility.

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied with the improved clarity and maintainability.
> Confident that the new naming convention will prevent future confusion.

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **User:** Make a taskmaster task that includes subtasks, and the subtasks follow the documented TDD workflow (see attached)

> **Assistant:** Taskmaster task created! Here's the new task and its subtasks, each following your documented TDD workflow...

> **User:** Add documentation IF NEEDED in three places: docs directory, PRD, engineering spec. No need to get approval; make the edits directly. Do not remove information that is there unless that information is incorrect.

> **Assistant:** Documentation updated in all required places. All tests passing. Task marked complete.
