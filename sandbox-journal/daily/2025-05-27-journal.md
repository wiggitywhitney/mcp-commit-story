### 2025-05-27T16:40:02 â€” Commit 0f144c20c051dabbeb8ba467a14179b0479d68f0

#### Summary

Added Task 23 to refactor journal directory creation to an on-demand pattern, including a detailed TDD-driven subtask plan. Updated related tasks (10, 11) to require on-demand directory creation for all journal file operations.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Created `tasks/task_023.txt` with a comprehensive breakdown for refactoring journal directory creation:
  - Only the base `journal/` directory will be created during initialization.
  - All subdirectories (e.g., `daily/`, `summaries/weekly/`) will be created on-demand by file operations.
  - Introduced a plan for a reusable `ensure_journal_directory(file_path)` utility function.
  - Updated acceptance criteria for related tasks to enforce the new pattern.
- Modified `tasks/tasks.json` and updated task files for 10 and 11 to reflect new requirements.
- Ensured all changes follow strict TDD and documentation standards.

#### Accomplishments
- Designed a clear, test-driven migration path from upfront to on-demand directory creation.
- Broke down the refactor into granular, dependency-aware subtasks for maintainability.
- Updated related tasks to ensure future work aligns with the new pattern.
- Maintained codebase and documentation consistency.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- None encountered; the planning and update process was straightforward.

#### Tone/Mood
> Focused, methodical
> Satisfied with the clarity and maintainability of the new plan
