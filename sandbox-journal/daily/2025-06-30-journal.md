# Daily Journal - June 30, 2025

### 5:34 AM â€” Reflection

I have a conference talk proposal due today. I want to make it about this MCP Commit Story project, and I thought to use the journal system to help me plan it. I'm asking it to output a bunch of summaries now. The problem with the entries is that the reader doesn't have enough context. These need to be able to be read by someone outside of the system, and that new person should understand the progress and challenges. "Systematic progression from infrastructre through breakthrough innovation to architecural maturity" isn't specific enough to mean anything. It doesn't hook into the real world and real human experience.
