## Summary
Completed subtask 4.9: "Instrument Context Collection Operations" by implementing comprehensive telemetry for Git operations and context collection with a beautiful clean decorator pattern. The implementation preserves AI prompts as the core functionality while adding performance optimization, memory tracking, and smart file sampling around them. Successfully integrated with existing MCP server telemetry infrastructure.

## Technical Synopsis
- **Enhanced `trace_git_operation` decorator**: Now accepts configurable performance thresholds and error categories, handling all telemetry logic internally
- **Clean function separation**: Context collection functions (`collect_git_context`, `collect_chat_history`, `collect_ai_terminal_commands`) now use declarative decorator syntax with zero telemetry noise in function bodies
- **Performance optimizations**: Built-in protections for large repositories (>100 files triggers summary mode), timeout protection (5s default), and smart file sampling (20% for repos >50 files)
- **Memory tracking**: Strategic memory monitoring with psutil, only recording metrics when memory increase exceeds 50MB threshold
- **Circuit breaker pattern**: Automatic telemetry disabling after repeated failures to ensure graceful degradation
- **Documentation updates**: Enhanced telemetry.md with Git operation examples, updated PRD and engineering spec with implementation details
- **Dependency addition**: Added psutil>=5.9.0 to pyproject.toml for memory tracking functionality

## Accomplishments
- ✅ Implemented TDD approach: wrote failing tests first, then clean implementation
- ✅ Achieved clean decorator pattern separation: zero telemetry code mixed with AI prompt logic
- ✅ Performance optimization built-in: large repository handling, timeouts, smart sampling
- ✅ Memory-conscious implementation: strategic monitoring without overhead
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation: updated three major documentation files
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility: existing context collection behavior unchanged
- ✅ Test coverage: comprehensive test suite validates telemetry behavior

## Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Initially made the critical mistake of removing AI prompts from context collection functions, nearly breaking the core functionality
- Had to debug RuntimeError in memory tracking context manager during test execution
- Circuit breaker implementation required careful consideration of failure scenarios

## Tone/Mood
> Extremely satisfied and proud of the elegant solution
> The decorator pattern feels "beautiful" and "clean" - a real breakthrough in separating concerns while maintaining full observability

## Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** "I don't understand how it could possibly be a good idea to lose the AI prompts that make up the heart of the context collection functions"
> **Agent:** Critical realization - the AI prompts ARE the implementation, not just documentation. Fixed by restoring all prompts while keeping telemetry in decorators.
> **Human:** "Out of curiousity, what do you think of this pattern? [...] @trace_git_operation with configuration"
> **Agent:** "I love this pattern! This is a much cleaner approach [...] Excellent Separation of Concerns"
> **Human:** "(^▽^)/ ʸᵉᔆᵎ"
