### 2025-05-25 08:47 — Commit bd5c6d7

#### Summary
Added comprehensive test coverage for all section TypedDicts and their integration with section generator functions. This work ensures that every journal section structure is validated, edge cases are handled, and future changes to context types will be caught by the test suite. The goal was to improve reliability, prevent silent type drift, and make the codebase safer for refactoring and extension.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Expanded `tests/unit/test_context_types.py` to cover all section TypedDicts: SummarySection, TechnicalSynopsisSection, AccomplishmentsSection, FrustrationsSection, ToneMoodSection, DiscussionNotesSection, TerminalCommandsSection, CommitMetadataSection.
- Added tests for edge cases (empty lists, None values, integration with section generators, and type safety enforcement).
- Validated that all section generator functions accept `JournalContext` and return the correct structure.
- Removed tests that expected runtime enforcement of TypedDict required fields, as Python does not enforce these without a runtime type checker.

#### Accomplishments
- Achieved full test coverage for all section context types and generator integration.
- Improved future reliability by catching type drift and edge cases early.
- Made the codebase safer for refactoring and extension by enforcing structure at the test level.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Python's `TypedDict` does not enforce required fields or types at runtime, requiring careful test design and the removal of some tests that were not meaningful without a runtime type checker.
- Balancing comprehensive coverage with practical test value required iteration and review of what runtime checks are possible.

#### Tone/Mood
> Thorough and quality-focused (high confidence)
> The work was detail-oriented, with a focus on long-term reliability and maintainability. There was some initial frustration with Python's lack of runtime type enforcement, but the end result is a robust and future-proof test suite.
