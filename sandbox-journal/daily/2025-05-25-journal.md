#### Summary
Implemented the tone/mood section generator for journal entries, including comprehensive tests and canonical naming. This work standardizes how developer emotional context is inferred and logged, and ensures future extensibility and clarity in the codebase.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added the `generate_tone_mood_section` function to `journal.py` with a detailed AI prompt and placeholder implementation.
- Updated all references, tests, and imports to use the new canonical function name.
- Improved docstrings and language translation guidelines for all section generators.
- Removed the legacy `generate_tone_section` and unified the codebase on the new pattern.
- Added and updated tests in both `unit/test_journal.py` and `test_journal_entry.py` to ensure correct function naming and behavior.

#### Accomplishments
- Standardized tone/mood section generator naming and implementation.
- Improved documentation and code comments for clarity and future maintainability.
- Ensured all tests pass or behave as expected (xfail/xpass for AI-dependent features).
- Enhanced language translation guidelines for all journal section generators.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Required careful coordination of function renaming and test updates to avoid breaking references.
- Some tests remain xfail due to unimplemented AI-driven logic, which is expected at this stage.

#### Tone/Mood
> Focused and methodical (high confidence)
> The work involved systematic refactoring, careful test updates, and attention to documentation. No major blockers or emotional swings were encountered, and the process was steady and detail-oriented.

### 2025-05-25 08:33 — Commit 0f83232

#### Summary
Implemented the discussion notes section generator for journal entries, completing the last major context-driven section. This work ensures that all relevant technical and emotional discussions from chat history can be extracted and attributed in journal entries, following strict anti-hallucination and formatting guidelines. The implementation included a detailed AI prompt, comprehensive tests, and full alignment with the canonical section generator pattern.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added the `generate_discussion_notes_section` function to `journal.py` with a detailed AI prompt and placeholder implementation.
- Removed the old stub and unified all references, imports, and tests to use the canonical function name.
- Updated and expanded tests in `unit/test_journal.py` to cover happy path, empty context, malformed chat, and output format scenarios.
- Improved section generator comments for consistency and clarity across all sections.
- Updated engineering documentation and task files to reflect the new implementation and test coverage.

#### Accomplishments
- Completed the implementation of the discussion notes section generator, finalizing the core set of journal section generators.
- Ensured all references, tests, and documentation use the correct canonical function name.
- Enhanced test coverage for edge cases and output format compliance.
- Maintained strict adherence to anti-hallucination and content guidelines in the AI prompt.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Required careful coordination to remove the stub, update all references, and avoid breaking tests.
- Some tests remain xfail due to the placeholder implementation and pending AI agent integration, which is expected at this stage.

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied and thorough (high confidence)
> The work involved methodical refactoring, comprehensive test updates, and attention to documentation and engineering standards. The process was steady, with a sense of completion as the last major section generator was finalized.
