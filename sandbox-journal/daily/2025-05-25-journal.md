#### Summary
Implemented the tone/mood section generator for journal entries, including comprehensive tests and canonical naming. This work standardizes how developer emotional context is inferred and logged, and ensures future extensibility and clarity in the codebase.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added the `generate_tone_mood_section` function to `journal.py` with a detailed AI prompt and placeholder implementation.
- Updated all references, tests, and imports to use the new canonical function name.
- Improved docstrings and language translation guidelines for all section generators.
- Removed the legacy `generate_tone_section` and unified the codebase on the new pattern.
- Added and updated tests in both `unit/test_journal.py` and `test_journal_entry.py` to ensure correct function naming and behavior.

#### Accomplishments
- Standardized tone/mood section generator naming and implementation.
- Improved documentation and code comments for clarity and future maintainability.
- Ensured all tests pass or behave as expected (xfail/xpass for AI-dependent features).
- Enhanced language translation guidelines for all journal section generators.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Required careful coordination of function renaming and test updates to avoid breaking references.
- Some tests remain xfail due to unimplemented AI-driven logic, which is expected at this stage.

#### Tone/Mood
> Focused and methodical (high confidence)
> The work involved systematic refactoring, careful test updates, and attention to documentation. No major blockers or emotional swings were encountered, and the process was steady and detail-oriented.
