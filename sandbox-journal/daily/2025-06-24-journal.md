### 6:44 AM â€” Reflection

Lately I feel that everytime I sit down to work, instead of getting something done, I'm finding holes and needing to refine and rework the plan itself. Perhaps in the future when I see that a big refactor is needed I can step back and take a good long time to do the planning, and use several models, like back when I wrote the engineering spec in the first place, before the project started. Right now I'm yearning for the good feeling of making real progress.
