# Journal Entry - July 3, 2025

### 11:57 AM â€” Reflection

I'm thinking that the journal entry layer should prioritize AI parse/readability over human readability and then MCP tools should exist that allow the user to ask arbitrary questions like "What did I do yesterday?" or "Summaries my March contributions to this repo"

Then there are two backend paths:
* One that auto-constructs a human-readable journal with daily, monthly, weekly, etc summaries 

* One that summarizes & chunks user data in an AI parseable/readable way so that the data is available & ready to answer these questions at any time granularity

Maybe having two paths is redundant. Maybe the best way is a human-readable journal that is very consistently formatted and tagged for AI. But the idea of MCP tools to ask AI to leverage journal knowledge to talk about past progress seems very nice.

That said, I'm not going to do any architectural changes now, I need to get to MVP.
