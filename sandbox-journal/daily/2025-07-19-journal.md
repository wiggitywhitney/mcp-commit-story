# Daily Journal Entries - July 19, 2025

### 7:31 AM — Commit 56de63f70bc57af006d1704851ede42091fedb22

#### Summary

In this commit, Whitney focused on verifying the journal generation system, crucial as she set things up on a new machine. The primary goal was to ensure that automatic journal entries are triggered via the git hook and to validate AI-powered content creation using OpenAI. She added a new test file, 'test_journal_workflow.md', which serves as a fallback to confirm that everything is functioning correctly. The testing process also included addressing issues with API keys, where she initially faced authentication failures for both OpenAI and Anthropic. After some troubleshooting and reminders to source the .env first, both API keys were successfully validated. Whitney's efforts are geared towards ensuring that the journaling system performs as expected, paving the way for effective documentation generation in her workflow.

#### Technical Synopsis

This commit introduces a new test file, `test_journal_workflow.md`, designed to verify the functionality of the journal generation system. The focus is on ensuring the automatic creation of journal entries through the configured git hook and utilizing AI-driven content generation using OpenAI.

#### Accomplishments

- Successfully installed and configured the journal generation system on the new computer.

- Verified that the system meets all dependencies requirements for Python 3.10.13.

- Set up the git hook to automatically generate journal entries upon commit.

- Loaded environment variables from .env file successfully, allowing both AI keys to work as expected.

- Created a new test file to confirm the functionality of the journal generation system.

- Verified proper journal entry creation in the 'sandbox-journal/daily/' directory with automatic triggers.

#### Tone/Mood

> relieved
> - Perfect! That fixed it!
- Excellent! Both API keys are working now!
- The issue was that I needed to source the .env file at the shell level first.

#### Discussion Notes (Simple Version)

> Here are the most interesting quotes from the conversation:
> > **Human:** "I'm accessing this repo for the first time on a new computer. Let's get stuff up and running so that journal entries are automatically generated here just like on my personal laptop."
> > **Human:** "The entries are triggered by git hook."
> > **Human:** "load env variables and test whether ANTHROPIC_API_KEY works from .env."
> > **Human:** "you shouldn't need to cat the .env."
> > **Human:** "did you do `source .env`?"
> > **Human:** "I don't think it will trigger an entry because no code has changed."

## MCP Server Troubleshooting Session - 2025-07-19

### Problem Analysis
The MCP commit story tools weren't appearing in Cursor despite being configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`. Through systematic debugging, identified two critical issues:

**1. Missing Python Dependencies**
- Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'toml'`
- Root cause: The project dependencies weren't installed in the current Python environment
- Solution: Ran `pip install -e .` and `pip install -e ".[dev]"` to install all required packages

**2. Incorrect Configuration Paths**
- Problem: `.cursor/mcp.json` contained outdated paths pointing to non-existent directories
- Wrong Python path: `/Users/wiggitywhitney/Repos/mcp-commit-story/.venv/bin/python` 
- Wrong working directory: `/Users/wiggitywhitney/Repos/mcp-commit-story`
- Correct Python path: `/Users/whitney.lee/.pyenv/shims/python`
- Correct working directory: `/Users/whitney.lee/Documents/Repositories/mcp-commit-story`

### Technical Investigation Process
1. **Initial Diagnosis**: Checked MCP server configuration and attempted to run server manually
2. **Dependency Discovery**: Found missing `toml` module when testing `python -m mcp_commit_story`
3. **Environment Setup**: Installed project dependencies using pip with editable installation
4. **Path Correction**: Updated `.cursor/mcp.json` with accurate file system paths
5. **Verification**: Confirmed server starts successfully with proper startup logs

### Key Learning: MCP Server Behavior
- MCP servers are persistent processes that communicate via stdio protocol
- The server "hanging" when run manually is normal - it's waiting for MCP protocol messages
- Startup logs showing "starting main loop" indicate successful initialization

### Available MCP Tools (Now Working)
- `journal_add_reflection`: Add manual reflections to journal entries
- `journal_capture_context`: Capture AI context for future journal entries

### Configuration Management Insight
This highlighted the importance of keeping MCP server configurations synchronized with actual file system paths and ensuring development environments have all dependencies properly installed. The hybrid architecture (git hooks + MCP server) requires both automatic journal generation and manual tool access to function properly.

Troubleshooting Session: Git Hook AI Failure Analysis

## Problem Identified
Journal entries showing poor AI content (e.g., commit 57b548e with 'consolodation' typo and basic fallback content) due to environment variable loading issue.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Git Hook Environment Testing**: Created debug script to capture environment variables available to git hooks
2. **Key Finding**: Git hooks DO inherit environment variables correctly - OPENAI_API_KEY is visible
3. **Actual Issue**: OPENAI_API_KEY still set to placeholder value 'your-openai-api-key-here' in ~/.zshrc line 56
4. **System Architecture**: Environment inheritance works correctly; AI provider fails gracefully with invalid key, triggering poor fallback content

## Technical Validation
- Git hook environment test confirmed full environment inheritance
- PATH, HOME, USER, and custom variables all properly available
- OPENAI_API_KEY present but with placeholder value
- Git hook execution model working as designed

## Solution Approach
**Immediate Fix**: Replace placeholder API key with real OpenAI API key in ~/.zshrc
**Long-term Fix**: Task 79 will implement automatic .env loading and better error handling for missing/invalid API keys

## Task 79 Relevance
This issue validates the design decisions in Task 79:
- Automatic .env loading will eliminate manual shell profile setup
- Better AI failure detection will provide clear error messages
- Improved fallback content will prevent typo-ridden journal entries
- Setup guidance will help users avoid this configuration trap

### 8:25 AM — Commit 0fb69d0b69f561247ec6bc175915533ffd2bd6d3

#### Summary

Here's the summary for the latest journal entry based on the provided context:

---

In today's commit, I focused on fixing the API key issue that was causing the journal entries to lack rich AI content. Earlier discussions revealed that the git hooks were not loading the environment variables correctly, which resulted in basic fallback messages rather than intelligent summaries. Specifically, the infamous commit 57b548e had a terrible entry due to the missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`. After troubleshooting, I confirmed that while the environment variables were inherited correctly during the git hook execution, the placeholder API key remained in the shell configuration. To address this, I replaced the placeholder with the actual API key from the `.env` file directly into `~/.zshrc`. Following this, I tested the setup and verified that the journal entries now generate with complete AI-enhanced content, solving the frustrating "consolodation" fallback problem and paving the way for a more intuitive user experience. The implementation of task 79 will further improve this architecture by automatically loading the `.env` files in git hooks and providing better error handling. For now, however, the immediate fix has restored functionality, ensuring that future journal entries will be both accurate and insightful.

--- 

This summary captures the essence of what changed, why it mattered, and the context provided by the developer's conversations and Git metadata.

#### Technical Synopsis

This commit is focused on testing the proper configuration of the OpenAI API key for enabling rich AI-generated journal entries. The previous issues stemmed from environment variable settings which were addressed during interactions with AI, as it became clear that git hooks do not automatically inherit environment configurations from shell profiles.. Initially, the journal generation process failed due to the absence of the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, leading to fallback to basic metadata outputs. Through a sequence of troubleshooting steps, it was verified that the placeholder key was still in use, prompting the immediate need for a proper API key to be sourced from the `.env` file.. In this commit, `test_working_state.txt` was modified to reflect the required functionality post API key configuration. The diff shows a minor edit to ensure the contextual message for journal entry creation is complete and correctly reflects the intended state without fallback indications. This modification aims to validate the successful implementation of the API key configuration as it now allows for genuine AI interaction during journal entry creation.. Future improvements will be implemented under parent task 79, which aims to automate the loading of environment variables in git hooks and improve error handling for instances when the API key is invalid or missing.

#### Accomplishments

- Configured the API key in the user's shell profile to enable rich AI-generated journal entries.

- Successfully replaced the placeholder API key in the ~/.zshrc file with the actual key retrieved from the .env file.

- Verified that the environment variable for the API key is now properly set, allowing the Git hooks to generate meaningful entries.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks

- Encountered a significant architectural flaw preventing automatic loading of environment variables in git hooks, which caused the AI to fail and fallback to generating a poor journal entry.

- Spent considerable time troubleshooting and discovered that the git hook didn't inherit the shell environment, leaving the API key unchanged at a placeholder value.

- Spent hours resolving the immediate issue of the placeholder API key, requiring adjustments to the user's shell profile for future commits to access AI features properly.

- Faced frustration with the lack of useful error messages when AI features fail, resulting in poor user experience and low-quality fallback journal entries.

> > **Human:** "Does the process load the environment variables somewhere?"
> > **Human:** "This should be fixed in the code, not by me individually, yes?"
> > **Human:** "In task 79, how many of those design decisions can be answered by looking at codebase patterns and documentation?"
> > **Human:** "The latest journal does not have AI intelligence so the env variables aren't loading"
> > **Human:** "Capture this troubleshooting in the journal. When the code fix happens as per task 79, will this problem resolved?\n\nPlease also fix it now in the short term so my journal entries will be rich"

#### Summary

Today, I dived into fixing a frustrating issue with AI journal enhancements that stemmed from a parameter mismatch in the context collection process. Initially, I was working on Task 79, which aimed to improve environment variable loading for git hooks, but I soon realized it was addressing the wrong problem—the real issue was that placeholder API keys were in use. That led to a terrible user experience with empty AI-enhanced journal entries. After verifying that git hooks actually call the configuration loading function, I decided to abandon Task 79 completely. Instead, I designed Task 80 to add OpenAI API key configuration to the `.mcp-commit-storyrc.yaml` file, which centralizes the configuration and introduces a cleaner approach without relying on environment variables. This new method simplifies the setup and makes the API key more discoverable, ultimately enhancing the user experience. As a quick fix to ensure smart journal entries immediately, I also uncovered a bug in the context collection function, which I corrected to ensure future entries would be AI-enhanced. Overall, it’s been a productive day, overcoming obstacles and refining the configuration system!

#### Technical Synopsis

This commit focuses on fixing the AI journal enhancement functionality by correcting the parameter order in the `collect_git_context` method calls within the journal-related processing scripts. The main issues addressed involved using the proper parameters while collecting git context, enabling accurate AI journal entries.

#### Accomplishments

- Completed: Fix AI journal enhancement: correct collect_git_context parameter order

- Successfully updated 4 files

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks

- Struggling with the realization that Task 79 is flawed and needs adjustments.

- Frustration expressed at the assistant for changing things without prior discussion.

- Spent time debugging why AI journal enhancements were not working despite having a valid API key.

- Getting frustrated with the placeholder API key causing silent AI failures and poor journal entries.

#### Summary

This commit focuses on enhancing the testing of the AI journal enhancement functionality following a recent fix. After realizing that the placeholder API key led to underwhelming journal entries, the developer sought to ensure smarter entries by addressing the underlying configuration issues tied to the OpenAI API key. During the troubleshooting process, they discovered a parameter mismatch in the context collection function, leading to the need for a precise parameter order when calling `collect_git_context`. Ultimately, the developer created a new test file that verifies that the `collect_git_context` is invoked correctly within both the `journal_workflow.py` and `journal_orchestrator.py` modules. This proactive step not only resolved existing issues but also reinforced the importance of adhering to TDD principles to prevent such bugs in the future. Their diligence in refining the AI enhancement has paved the way for a more robust and user-friendly journaling experience moving forward.

#### Technical Synopsis

This commit focuses on enhancing the testing framework surrounding the correction of parameter handling in the context collection functions. Specifically, it introduces tests aimed at verifying that the `collect_git_context` function is called with the correct parameters across various journal processing scripts, ensuring the accuracy of generated AI-based journal entries. {'description': "A set of tests was added in the `test_collect_git_context_parameter_fix.py` file. These tests are designed to confirm that the `collect_git_context` function is invoked with the correct parameter order, critical for avoiding the 'InvalidGitRepositoryError' that arises when passing incorrect positional arguments.", 'file_updated': 'tests/unit/test_collect_git_context_parameter_fix.py', 'changes': ['Added test cases that mock various context collection methods.', 'Used the unittest.mock library to patch the relevant functions and verify the correct interaction among them.']}. {'description': "The tests validate the proper parameter order for the `collect_git_context` method in both `journal_workflow.py` and `journal_orchestrator.py`.

### 5:16 PM — Commit 3197430787f38db61c49f47a28ef079e0cf8f02e

#### Summary

Today, we continued to work through some issues related to the OpenAI API key configuration and its integration into the project's git hooks. Initially, there was confusion stemming from a flawed approach in Task 79, which incorrectly assumed the root cause of issues was with environment variable loading. Through our discussions, it became clear that the real problem stemmed from using placeholder values instead of valid API keys. This prompted a shift to a more robust solution, culminating in Task 80, which proposes centralizing API key management in the `.mcp-commit-storyrc.yaml` configuration file instead of relying on environment variables. The recent commit primarily involved adding a diagnostic test to check for the differences in the git hook environment, highlighting that the system still needs to be foolproof in different setups. The AI enhancements are currently functioning inconsistently, likely due to environment-specific issues since switching machines. We're set to explore fixes to ensure that every journal entry is intelligently enhanced moving forward, ensuring it captures not just metadata but also the rich context of development work.

#### Technical Synopsis

In this commit, a new diagnostic test has been added in the file `diagnostic_test.txt` to investigate differences in the git hook environment. The test aims to address intermittent issues with AI enhancement in journal entries. The commit does not introduce any changes to the main application code, as it primarily serves as a testing mechanism to isolate the problems related to network connectivity or environment settings on the new machine. {'file': 'diagnostic_test.txt', 'changes': ["Added a diagnostic script that tests network reliability to OpenAI's API and captures potential discrepancies in environment behavior."]}. {'context': 'This diagnostic test is critical for isolating the cause of the inconsistent AI enhancement behavior previously observed when switching computers. The test includes multiple attempts to reach the OpenAI API to ascertain network reliability and responsiveness.'}.

#### Accomplishments

- Completed: Diagnostic: test git hook environment differences

- Modified diagnostic_test.txt

### 5:17 PM — Commit c35533d28e92d7a476f9310bf5b23ab7cba51920

#### Summary

In this commit, Whitney Lee tackled some necessary maintenance by cleaning up the diagnostic test file. Specifically, the file `diagnostic_test.txt` was deleted after confirming it was no longer needed. This file contained only a timestamp from a previous test, which had likely outlived its usefulness in the current context. By removing this obsolete file, Whitney streamlined the project's structure, making it clearer and more efficient. This small yet important action contributes to keeping the codebase tidy and focused on relevant tests, ensuring that future work can proceed without the distraction of outdated files.

#### Technical Synopsis

In this commit, the author has cleaned up the diagnostic test file, specifically by deleting the file named 'diagnostic_test.txt'. This file, which contained a single line indicating a simple diagnostic message regarding the git hook environment timestamp, was determined to be unnecessary for the project's current structure or requirements. The change classifies as a small adjustment and contributes to a cleaner codebase by removing potentially outdated or redundant test files. There are no alterations to source, configuration, or testing files in this commit, which emphasizes a focused effort towards improving documentation with the intention of maintaining clarity and relevance in the project's test assets.

#### Accomplishments

- Completed: Clean up diagnostic test file

- Modified diagnostic_test.txt

### 5:21 PM — Commit 77a668ac264d219bb982e00183ad2c39b67950bb

#### Summary

Today, I made significant strides in diagnosing the intermittent AI failures that have been plaguing my journal entries since I switched computers. Frustratingly, my recent entries only sporadically featured AI enhancements, which led me to dive deep into troubleshooting. I noticed that, while the AI worked perfectly in manual tests, it sometimes returned only basic metadata during git hook executions. This prompted me to enhance error logging in `ai_provider.py`, capturing detailed failure information such as error types, response statuses, and environmental contexts. The goal is to better understand the underlying causes of these failures, which appear to stem from differences in the execution environments—often exacerbated by network conditions or system load. While I initially considered switching to a background worker mode to sidestep these issues, reflecting on the situation made me realize that it would merely mask the problem rather than address it. I'm committed to uncovering the true source of the failures through robust logging first, ensuring I can pinpoint the exact environmental discrepancies causing these intermittent AI issues.

#### Technical Synopsis

This commit involved significant enhancements to the error logging mechanism within the `OpenAIProvider` class, specifically targeting the troubleshooting of intermittent AI failures during the journal entry generation process.

#### Accomplishments

- Completed: Add enhanced error logging for diagnosing intermittent AI failures

- Comprehensive error details (type, module, response status)
- Environment context (working dir, PATH, PYTHONPATH, API key status)
- System context (timestamp, PID, payload sizes)
- Both log file and console output for immediate visibility
- Designed to diagnose computer-specific intermittent failures

- Modified src/mcp_commit_story/ai_provider.py

#### Tone/Mood

> frustrated
> - I hate when you just change stuff without talking to me first
- That journal entry is just basic metadata, not AI-enhanced at all.
- Why on earth would that have not been a problem this morning but it is now?
- AI journal enhancement is failing because there's a parameter mismatch in the git context collection.

### 5:24 PM — AI Context Capture

## AI Journal Enhancement Intermittent Failure - Troubleshooting Guide

**FOR FUTURE AI AGENTS**: This is a documented troubleshooting process for the intermittent AI enhancement failures that occur in git hook execution on this computer.

### Problem Symptoms
- AI journal enhancement works sometimes, fails other times
- When it fails: only basic metadata (commit hash, timestamp, basic accomplishments)
- When it works: full AI content (rich summary, technical synopsis, tone/mood, discussion notes)
- Issue started after switching computers - worked consistently on previous machine
- Network connectivity and API key are confirmed working in manual tests

### Diagnostic Process Completed (2025-07-19)

**✅ Tests That PASSED (ruled out as root cause):**
1. **Network reliability**: 5/5 OpenAI API calls succeeded from terminal
2. **Python environment**: Standard Python 3.10.13, OpenAI 1.97.0 package
3. **API key configuration**: Valid key confirmed, works in manual tests
4. **Git hook execution**: Sometimes works perfectly (diagnostic commit just succeeded)

**❌ Confirmed Issue Pattern:**
- Intermittent failures during git hook execution only
- Manual AI calls from terminal always work
- Some git hook executions work perfectly, others fail completely
- Timing difference: Working entries take 14-35 seconds, failed entries complete in 1-3 seconds

### Enhanced Error Logging Added
Located in `src/mcp_commit_story/ai_provider.py` - captures when failures occur:
- Full error details (type, module, HTTP status, response text)
- Environment context (working directory, PATH, PYTHONPATH, API key status)
- System context (timestamp, PID, payload sizes)
- Both log file (.git/hooks/mcp-commit-story.log) and console output

### Error Pattern to Watch For
Previous failures showed: "AI returned invalid JSON response: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"
This indicates OpenAI API call is returning empty response, not a JSON parsing issue.

### Next Steps When Issue Recurs
1. **Check git hook logs**: Look for detailed error info in `.git/hooks/mcp-commit-story.log`
2. **Check console output**: Git hook now prints immediate error visibility
3. **Compare environment**: Working vs failing execution environment differences
4. **Look for patterns**: System load, network conditions, time of day correlations

### Alternative Solutions if Root Cause Cannot Be Fixed
- Background worker mode (`mcp-commit-story install-hook --background`) 
- BUT this masks the problem rather than fixing it
- Current approach: Identify and fix the real environment difference

### Key Insight
The issue is **environment-specific** to git hook execution context vs normal shell execution. The git hook environment has some constraint (network access, system resources, environment variables) that occasionally prevents OpenAI API calls from succeeding.

**Status**: Enhanced logging deployed, monitoring for next failure to capture diagnostic details.

#### Summary

In today’s development session, I tackled the inconsistencies with AI-enhanced journal entries that have been frustrating after switching computers. The AI is supposed to enrich my journal entries automatically, but I've noticed they sometimes end up as basic metadata when I commit from my terminal, while entries made through Cursor's environment remain richly detailed. This pointed me toward a deeper issue with how environment variables, specifically the OpenAI API key, are being handled—turns out, my terminal was using a placeholder value during the commit process, leading to those 'dumb' entries. As a quick interim solution, I sourced the `.env` file to ensure the correct API key is loaded for future commits, but the bigger fix lies in implementing Task 80. This task will consolidate the API key configuration into a project-specific configuration file, allowing for `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` interpolation, and eliminating the confusion caused by our current reliance on potentially incorrect environment variables. I even added comprehensive logging to help diagnose any intermittent issues further as they arise. I'm feeling positive about these changes, and eager to see if they improve my journal entries moving forward!

#### Technical Synopsis

In this commit, a new test file, `test.txt`, was added to explore the behavior of journal entries generated from the terminal environment. This investigation aimed to uncover the inconsistencies experienced, particularly the presence of 'dumb' journal entries, which are void of AI enhancement details, contrasted with 'smart' entries generated through the coding assistant's terminal environment. The commit effectively serves as a baseline for understanding the terminal setup's influence on AI integration within the journal generation framework.

#### Accomplishments

- Completed: Will this journal entry be 'smart'?

- Modified test.txt

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks

- I hate when you just change stuff without talking to me first

- AI journal enhancement is failing because there's a parameter mismatch in the git context collection.

- The git hook environment has different network access/system load than manual execution.

- The intermittent AI enhancement failures in git hooks (works sometimes, fails others).

- Need to check if the AI sections are actually empty strings rather than missing.

- Intermittent nature suggests environment differences between git hook execution and shell execution.

- The 'dumb' journal entries were caused by running the commit from my terminal, which had a placeholder API key.

#### Tone/Mood

> frustrated
> - I hate when you just change stuff without talking to me first
- I think journal entries are 'dumb' when I run the commit from my terminal and they're smart when you do the commit
- Wait. Can someone reference an env var in their config?

### 5:34 PM — AI Context Capture

SOLUTION DISCOVERED: 'Dumb' vs 'Smart' Journal Entries Root Cause and Fix

**Problem**: Journal entries were inconsistently AI-enhanced - 'smart' when assistant commits, 'dumb' when user commits from terminal.

**Root Cause**: User's terminal environment had placeholder OpenAI API key (`your-key-here`) instead of real API key, causing AI enhancement to fail silently.

**Immediate Solution**: Run `source .env` in terminal before committing to load correct environment variables. This immediately restored full AI enhancement.

**Verification**: After sourcing .env, journal entries became 'smart' again with rich AI content including technical synopsis, accomplishments, frustrations, and discussion notes.

**Permanent Solution**: Task 80 will implement API key configuration in `.mcp-commit-storyrc.yaml` with `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` interpolation, eliminating need for manual env loading and preventing this issue for future users.

**Key Insight**: Git hooks inherit shell environment, so incorrect env vars in user's shell directly cause AI failures in commit-triggered journal generation.

### 5:35 PM — Commit dfc812c8888298024a2e4fcbd045cf3fbe8ad027

#### Summary

Today, I made significant progress in addressing the AI enhancement issues in my journal entries. The root of the problem stemmed from the inconsistency of AI-generated content: entries created from my terminal were often just basic metadata, while those made through the assistant's terminal featured rich, detailed summaries. After some detective work and discussions, it became clear that my terminal was using a placeholder OpenAI API key instead of the actual key, causing the AI calls to fail. To solve the immediate issue, I sourced the `.env` file to ensure the correct API key was loaded, which quickly resulted in 'smart' entries. However, the long-term solution lies in Task 80, where we’ll implement API key configurations in the `.mcp-commit-storyrc.yaml`, allowing for `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` interpolation. This change will prevent future users from needing to manually load environment variables, ensuring consistent and reliable AI enhancements across all environments. I also added enhanced logging for better diagnosis of intermittent failures, creating a comprehensive troubleshooting guide in the journal to help future AI agents navigate any similar issues.

### 5:55 PM — Commit 82f654146c3814ec0d11978a09983ef7e8ab6353

#### Summary

In this commit, I focused on enhancing the configuration system by implementing environment variable interpolation, which serves as a long-term solution to the problems encountered with the OpenAI API key. The motivation behind this change stemmed from discovering that users often set placeholder API keys in their shell profiles, leading to silent failures in AI functionality. To address this, I centralized the API key configuration within the `.mcp-commit-storyrc.yaml` file, allowing a `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` syntax for seamless environment variable interpolation. This update not only simplifies the setup for future users but also improves robustness by eliminating the manual loading of environment variables. During the implementation, I encountered some challenges, particularly with ensuring that the telemetry system operates correctly without breaking the functionality during tests. All tests for the new interpolation feature passed, confirming that the recursive processing of strings, dictionaries, and lists works as intended, while also providing comprehensive validation for unresolved variables. As a result, the groundwork is now set for integrating the AI configuration section in the next task.

#### Technical Synopsis

In this commit, the primary focus was the introduction of environment variable interpolation into the configuration system, specifically addressing the need for more robust handling of API key configurations within `.mcp-commit-storyrc.yaml`. This change was necessary to eliminate issues related to users inadvertently setting placeholder API keys in their shell profiles, which led to failures during automated AI enhancements.

#### Accomplishments

- Completed: Add environment variable interpolation to config system

- Successfully updated 5 files

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)

> The chat history provided contains a number of exchanges, but they largely revolve around routine task management, confirmations, and simple status updates without the depth of technical reasoning or emotional insights that would be valuable for a development discussion journal. Furthermore, most discussions are task-oriented with little exploration of the developer's problem-solving strategies, insights, or learning moments.
> As a result, I found no significant quotes that would contribute to a meaningful discussion notes section. Thus, I will return an empty list as per the guidelines.
