# Daily Journal Entries - July 19, 2025

### 7:31 AM — Commit 56de63f70bc57af006d1704851ede42091fedb22

#### Summary

In this commit, Whitney focused on verifying the journal generation system, crucial as she set things up on a new machine. The primary goal was to ensure that automatic journal entries are triggered via the git hook and to validate AI-powered content creation using OpenAI. She added a new test file, 'test_journal_workflow.md', which serves as a fallback to confirm that everything is functioning correctly. The testing process also included addressing issues with API keys, where she initially faced authentication failures for both OpenAI and Anthropic. After some troubleshooting and reminders to source the .env first, both API keys were successfully validated. Whitney's efforts are geared towards ensuring that the journaling system performs as expected, paving the way for effective documentation generation in her workflow.

#### Technical Synopsis

This commit introduces a new test file, `test_journal_workflow.md`, designed to verify the functionality of the journal generation system. The focus is on ensuring the automatic creation of journal entries through the configured git hook and utilizing AI-driven content generation using OpenAI.

#### Accomplishments

- Successfully installed and configured the journal generation system on the new computer.

- Verified that the system meets all dependencies requirements for Python 3.10.13.

- Set up the git hook to automatically generate journal entries upon commit.

- Loaded environment variables from .env file successfully, allowing both AI keys to work as expected.

- Created a new test file to confirm the functionality of the journal generation system.

- Verified proper journal entry creation in the 'sandbox-journal/daily/' directory with automatic triggers.

#### Tone/Mood

> relieved
> - Perfect! That fixed it!
- Excellent! Both API keys are working now!
- The issue was that I needed to source the .env file at the shell level first.

#### Discussion Notes (Simple Version)

> Here are the most interesting quotes from the conversation:
> > **Human:** "I'm accessing this repo for the first time on a new computer. Let's get stuff up and running so that journal entries are automatically generated here just like on my personal laptop."
> > **Human:** "The entries are triggered by git hook."
> > **Human:** "load env variables and test whether ANTHROPIC_API_KEY works from .env."
> > **Human:** "you shouldn't need to cat the .env."
> > **Human:** "did you do `source .env`?"
> > **Human:** "I don't think it will trigger an entry because no code has changed."

### 8:05 AM — AI Context Capture

## MCP Server Troubleshooting Session - 2025-07-19

### Problem Analysis
The MCP commit story tools weren't appearing in Cursor despite being configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`. Through systematic debugging, identified two critical issues:

**1. Missing Python Dependencies**
- Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'toml'`
- Root cause: The project dependencies weren't installed in the current Python environment
- Solution: Ran `pip install -e .` and `pip install -e ".[dev]"` to install all required packages

**2. Incorrect Configuration Paths**
- Problem: `.cursor/mcp.json` contained outdated paths pointing to non-existent directories
- Wrong Python path: `/Users/wiggitywhitney/Repos/mcp-commit-story/.venv/bin/python` 
- Wrong working directory: `/Users/wiggitywhitney/Repos/mcp-commit-story`
- Correct Python path: `/Users/whitney.lee/.pyenv/shims/python`
- Correct working directory: `/Users/whitney.lee/Documents/Repositories/mcp-commit-story`

### Technical Investigation Process
1. **Initial Diagnosis**: Checked MCP server configuration and attempted to run server manually
2. **Dependency Discovery**: Found missing `toml` module when testing `python -m mcp_commit_story`
3. **Environment Setup**: Installed project dependencies using pip with editable installation
4. **Path Correction**: Updated `.cursor/mcp.json` with accurate file system paths
5. **Verification**: Confirmed server starts successfully with proper startup logs

### Key Learning: MCP Server Behavior
- MCP servers are persistent processes that communicate via stdio protocol
- The server "hanging" when run manually is normal - it's waiting for MCP protocol messages
- Startup logs showing "starting main loop" indicate successful initialization

### Available MCP Tools (Now Working)
- `journal_add_reflection`: Add manual reflections to journal entries
- `journal_capture_context`: Capture AI context for future journal entries

### Configuration Management Insight
This highlighted the importance of keeping MCP server configurations synchronized with actual file system paths and ensuring development environments have all dependencies properly installed. The hybrid architecture (git hooks + MCP server) requires both automatic journal generation and manual tool access to function properly.
