### 2025-05-21 06:08 — Commit b11f253

#### Summary

Implemented comprehensive formatting improvements for journal entry generation, including header hierarchy, spacing, code block consistency, and blockquote clarity. All changes were developed using a strict TDD approach, with new tests added and verified for each formatting rule. This update enhances the readability and maintainability of engineering journal entries.

#### Accomplishments
- Refactored `JournalEntry.to_markdown()` to support:

- H3 for entry header and H4 for section headers

- Blank lines after section headers and between bullet points

- Blank lines on speaker change in discussion notes

- Terminal commands as a single bash code block

- Visually distinct blockquotes

- Added and updated tests in `tests/test_journal_entry.py` to cover all new formatting rules

- Updated documentation and task files to reflect new formatting requirements

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor confusion around code block counting in tests (opening/closing markers)

- Needed to adjust test logic to match markdown conventions

### 2025-05-21 06:45 — Commit bbe7723

#### Summary

Advanced the core infrastructure for engineering journal management by implementing and testing file operations. This work lays the foundation for reliable, structured, and extensible journal entry storage, following the project's narrative-first and signal-over-noise philosophy. The approach ensures that future entries will be easy to locate, append, and analyze, supporting the long-term goal of meaningful engineering storytelling.

#### Accomplishments
- Designed and implemented `get_journal_file_path()` to enforce consistent, date-based file naming for all journal and summary types.
- Built `create_journal_directories()` to guarantee the required directory structure exists before writing, reducing friction for future features.
- Developed `append_to_journal_file()` to robustly append entries, insert horizontal rules for clarity, and create files as needed.
- Wrote and validated comprehensive TDD tests for all file operations, including error handling and edge cases.
- Ensured all file operations are modular and ready for integration with higher-level journal logic.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Encountered minor ambiguity in how to best parameterize file naming for future summary types (weekly, monthly, yearly).
- Needed to balance simplicity with extensibility, as much of the higher-level journal logic is not yet implemented.
- Some uncertainty about how future context collection and section generation will interact with file operations.

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Implement file operations with tests"
git show --stat --patch bbe7723
git diff --stat bbe7723^ bbe7723
git diff --unified=0 bbe7723^ bbe7723 | head -n 40

git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h' bbe7723
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%s' bbe7723
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Please make another entry for the same commit. This time additionally use journal.py as a reference for formatting and content guidelines, but keep in mind that much of the code here isn't implemented yet.

> **Agent:** All file operations functions are now implemented and fully passing their tests! The code matches your directory structure, naming conventions, and appending logic. The implementation automatically creates parent directories and handles file system errors as expected. All 8 TDD tests for file operations are green.

#### Tone/Mood
> Accomplished
> The file operations layer is now reliable, well-tested, and ready for integration with higher-level journal features.

### 2025-05-21 06:59 — Commit 870c226

#### Summary

Reorganized the project's journal files by renaming the parent directory to `sandbox-journal` and moving all sample entries accordingly. This change clarifies the distinction between experimental/practice data and production journal entries, supporting a more maintainable and narrative-driven workflow as outlined in the project's content quality guidelines.

#### Accomplishments
- Renamed the main journal directory from `journal` to `sandbox-journal` for clarity and separation of experimental data
- Moved all sample daily journal entries into the new structure, preserving date-based naming conventions
- Ensured the new directory structure matches the engineering spec and supports future extensibility

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- None encountered; the reorganization was straightforward and required only careful file moves and renames

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Rename journal directory to sandbox-journal and move all sample entries accordingly"
git show --stat --patch 870c226
git diff --stat 870c226^ 870c226
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Make a journal entry for this git commit as outlined in engineering spec. append it to sandbox-journal/daily/2025-05-21-journal.md. Additionally use journal.py as a reference for formatting and content guidelines, but keep in mind that much of the code here isn't implemented yet.

> **Agent:** This entry follows the narrative and content quality guidelines from journal.py, focusing on the rationale for the reorganization and its impact on future development and maintainability.

#### Tone/Mood
> Organized
> The project structure is now clearer and better supports experimentation and future growth.

#### Reflections (2025-05-21 07:05)
I'm still not happy with the terminal commands in the journal entries being mostly git commits and the discussion notes too often being about journal entry creation, but I'm going to wait and see whether that works itself out as more functionality gets implemented. 

- (2025-05-21 07:15) In the "Mood" section, is AI overstepping? I designed it to reference explicit indicators, and if it has none then omit the section for that entry. Watch this.

#### Accomplishments
- Added a new reflection to today's journal entry with a manual timestamp, following the current guidelines
- Updated the Reflections section to include both general and timestamped entries
- Maintained consistency with the narrative-first, signal-over-noise philosophy

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Ongoing uncertainty about the best way to handle mood/tone and AI-generated content in journal entries
- Balancing automation with explicit user intent for reflections and meta-commentary

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)

### 2025-05-21 17:57 — Commit c9928e2

#### Summary

Implemented the core context collection functions and comprehensive tests for the engineering journal system. This update introduces AI-powered collection of chat history and terminal commands, with robust anti-hallucination rules and user-driven configuration. The work ensures that future journal entries will be grounded in real context, with clear boundaries and filtering, and sets the stage for reliable, narrative-driven engineering documentation.

#### Accomplishments
- Added `collect_chat_history()` and `collect_ai_terminal_commands()` with detailed AI prompts and anti-hallucination checklists
- Refactored and cleaned up all context collection and Git utility tests to require real logic
- Removed obsolete mock-based and redundant functions (e.g., `get_discussion_notes`)
- Documented all requirements and user decisions in code comments and docstrings
- Achieved a clean, passing test suite for all context collection and Git utility functions

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Some uncertainty about how to best integrate AI context extraction with future CLI workflows
- The need to balance thoroughness with performance for large chat/command histories

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Implement context collection functions with tests"
pytest tests/unit/test_context_collection.py
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Please add anti-hallucination rules to the two AI prompts and the two checklists
>
> **AI:** Anti-hallucination rules have been added to both AI prompts and checklists in the docstrings for `collect_chat_history` and `collect_ai_terminal_commands`, making it explicit that the AI must not invent, infer, or summarize information not present in the actual history.
