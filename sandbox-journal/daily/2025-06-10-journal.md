I've identified a problem with my system and that is AI doesn't have access to older conversation chat. It has a "synthesized conversation summary" which the current implementation might miss out on because it is so focused on getting the chat verbatim.

I need to try and understand this summary better and adjust my prompt to capture it. Or better yet, make a new prompt that captures the "synthesized conversation summary". This summary seems unique to Cursor though so I'll making it so this MCP server is for Cursor only. Or maybe Cursor-enhanced. 

Also I'm thinking about running a cronjob (or similar) that would save our most recent chat to a file, then use that files as a source for journal entries. And probably wipe the file after each entry. AI says this is a good idea but then again they said my chat collection prompt was a good ideas and it is turning out not to be. The "max messages" set to 150 is laughable.
