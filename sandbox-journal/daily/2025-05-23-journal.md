#### Summary

Marked Task 5.11 (Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures) as in progress and logged a detailed implementation plan. This foundational work will formalize the data structures for context collection, improving maintainability and reducing errors for all downstream section generator tasks. The plan includes collaboration steps, a test-driven approach, and updates to both code and documentation.

#### Accomplishments

- Advanced the project by prioritizing foundational architecture work (Task 5.11) before implementing section generators, ensuring a clean and robust design.

- Logged a comprehensive plan for Task 5.11, including objectives, collaboration steps, test strategy, and implementation plan, directly in the subtask details.

- Updated task status and details in both tasks.json and task_005.txt, maintaining alignment between code and project management artifacts.

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)

> **User:** Task 5.11 (Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures) makes more sense to tackle next before jumping to 5.13. Here's why: Task 5.11 is the logical next step because: Dependency chain: 5.11 depends on 5.3 (which is done), and 5.12 depends on 5.11. Foundation work: It formalizes the data structures that all the section generators (5.13-5.19) will use. Clean architecture: Having proper type definitions will make implementing the section generators much cleaner and less error-prone. Task 5.13 (generate_summary_section) would be premature because: It's part of the section generators that should logically come after the data structures are formalized. Without clear data structure definitions, we'd be designing the section generator API in the dark. The engineering spec emphasizes the importance of proper type hints and documentation. What Task 5.11 involves: Adding TypedDict or dataclass definitions for context collection return values. Documenting the expected structure in code and docs. Ensuring the in-memory-only rule is properly codified. Updating code comments to reference these definitions. This aligns perfectly with the engineering spec's emphasis on: "Add explicit type hints, TypedDict, or dataclass definitions for the returned data". I want to mark 5.11 as in progress and log a plan that includes the subtask objective plus collaboration steps, Tests (and making sure they're failing before implementation), finding and updating existing functions (like those in journal.py) and updating existing tasks to test for data structures moving forward.

> **AI:** Task 5.11 ("Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures") is now marked as in progress, and your detailed implementation plan and rationale have been logged to the subtask. This approach will provide a strong foundation for all subsequent section generator tasks and aligns with the engineering spec's emphasis on explicit type hints and documentation.
