### Summary

Successfully implemented Task 46.1 "Core Query Execution Module" following strict TDD methodology, creating the fundamental database query execution functionality for Cursor chat databases with comprehensive error handling, connection management, and SQL injection protection. The implementation involved writing 17 comprehensive failing tests first, then building the `execute_cursor_query` function to make all tests pass, establishing the foundation that subsequent subtasks will use for message extraction and database operations.

### Technical Synopsis

**Core Implementation:**
- Created `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/query_executor.py` with the main `execute_cursor_query(db_path, query, parameters=None)` function
- Implemented fixed 5-second timeout for database connections as per approved design choices
- Added comprehensive error wrapping in custom exceptions: `CursorDatabaseAccessError`, `CursorDatabaseQueryError`, `CursorDatabaseNotFoundError`
- Built proper context manager usage for automatic connection cleanup
- Established parameterized query safety to prevent SQL injection attacks

**Test Coverage:**
- Created comprehensive test suite `tests/unit/test_cursor_db_query_executor.py` with 17 test cases
- Success cases: simple queries, parameterized queries, empty results, return format validation
- Error handling: invalid paths, malformed SQL, locked database, parameter mismatches
- Parameter safety: SQL injection prevention, None handling, empty tuples
- Connection management: timeout enforcement, context manager cleanup

**Architecture Quality:**
- Function signature: `execute_cursor_query(db_path: str, query: str, parameters: Optional[Tuple[Any, ...]] = None) -> List[Tuple[Any, ...]]`
- Returns standardized `List[Tuple[Any, ...]]` format for consistent data handling
- Follows Test-Driven Development: write failing tests → implement functionality → verify tests pass
- Enhanced cursor_db package exports with new query_executor function

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/query_executor.py`: New core query execution module (113 lines)
- `tests/unit/test_cursor_db_query_executor.py`: Comprehensive test suite (410 lines)
- `src/mcp_commit_story/cursor_db/__init__.py`: Added execute_cursor_query export
- `docs/cursor-chat-database-research.md`: Enhanced with implementation section (32 new lines)
- `tasks/tasks.json`: Updated task 46.1 status to complete

**Test Results:** All 17 new tests pass + 867 total tests in full suite pass with no regressions

### Accomplishments

- ✅ **Successfully completed Task 46.1** - "Core Query Execution Module" following approved TDD methodology
- ✅ **Implemented comprehensive error handling** with proper custom exception wrapping for database access errors
- ✅ **Created robust test coverage** with 17 test cases covering all success and failure scenarios 
- ✅ **Established SQL injection protection** through parameterized query support and validation
- ✅ **Built efficient connection management** with 5-second timeout and automatic cleanup via context managers
- ✅ **Enhanced project architecture** by adding execute_cursor_query to cursor_db package exports
- ✅ **Updated documentation** with comprehensive implementation details in cursor-chat-database-research.md
- ✅ **Maintained backward compatibility** with all existing cursor_db functionality preserved
- ✅ **Validated integration** with full test suite pass (867 tests) confirming no regressions

### Frustrations

- Had to debug test mocking issues where the tests were trying to catch mocked sqlite3 exceptions instead of the real ones, requiring adjustment of the exception handling approach
- Needed to fix context manager mocking configuration for proper cleanup testing, which required using MagicMock instead of regular Mock objects
- The initial implementation had some edge cases in error handling that required iteration to ensure all test scenarios passed correctly

### Discussion Notes

> **Human:** "Read this last two days' worth of journal entries to understand what we are working on I want to start with task 46.1. Mark it in-progres and mark the parent task as in-progress and summarize what you'll do. Once I approve then start with implementation"

> **AI:** "Perfect! I can see from the journal entries that we've completed Task 45 (SQLite Workspace Detection and Reader) and now we're moving to Task 46 (Implement Direct Database Query Function). The task has already been planned with detailed subtasks and even has approved design choices documented."

> **Human:** "So are we querying for human-side chat and AI-side chat as part of this task?"

> **AI:** "Great question! Let me clarify the scope of task 46.1 specifically. **No, Task 46.1 is just the foundational query executor** - we're not implementing the specific human/AI chat querying yet."

> **Human:** "I see. Thanks. Please start!"

> **AI:** "Perfect! Let's start with Task 46.1 following strict TDD methodology. First, I'll examine the existing cursor_db structure to understand the patterns, then write failing tests."

### Terminal Commands

```bash
# Running the test suite for the new query executor module
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_cursor_db_query_executor.py -v

# Testing import functionality
python -c "from mcp_commit_story.cursor_db import execute_cursor_query; print('✅ execute_cursor_query successfully imported')"

# Running full test suite to verify no regressions
python -m pytest tests/ -x --tb=short
```

### Tone & Mood

**Mood:** Systematic and accomplished  
**Indicators:** The successful completion of Task 46.1 demonstrates methodical TDD execution with careful attention to comprehensive testing and error handling. The phrase "Perfect! Let's start" shows enthusiasm for tackling complex technical implementation, while the systematic approach of examining existing patterns first indicates thoughtful architectural consideration. The achievement of 17 passing tests and full suite validation represents satisfaction with thorough, quality-driven development practices.
