### 2025-05-26 07:02:09 -0500 — Commit 62dcb3f

#### Summary

Scaffolded the MCP server core for mcp-commit-story, including dynamic version loading, config, and stub-aware telemetry integration.

- Followed strict TDD: wrote failing tests for server instantiation, config, and telemetry before implementation; all tests pass after implementation.
- Added user-facing and engineering documentation for server setup and configuration.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Added `src/mcp_commit_story/server.py` with `create_mcp_server()`, `register_tools()`, and version/config/telemetry logic.
- Updated engineering spec and PRD to reflect actual FastMCP API and TDD process.
- Created `docs/server_setup.md` for outside users.
- Tests in `tests/unit/test_server.py` now cover config, version, and telemetry logic.

#### Accomplishments
- Strict TDD cycle completed for server initialization
- Dynamic version loading from pyproject.toml
- Stub-aware telemetry integration
- User-facing documentation for server setup
- Engineering spec and PRD updated for clarity

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- FastMCP does not support startup/shutdown hooks; had to adapt to config/telemetry setup before instantiation

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> TDD process and documentation led to a robust, user-friendly server foundation

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** How do cursor rules compare to the memory mcp server?

> **AI:** Cursor rules are for code/workflow conventions; memory MCP server is a structured, queryable knowledge base for project state and dependencies. They are complementary.

## Summary
- Implemented the Core Error Handling System for the MCP server, including a custom MCPError class and handle_mcp_error decorator for robust, structured error responses.
- Strict TDD: wrote failing tests for error handling, implemented the logic, and confirmed all tests pass.
- Updated engineering spec, PRD, and user docs to document the error handling pattern and requirements.

## Technical Synopsis
- Added MCPError exception and handle_mcp_error decorator to src/mcp_commit_story/server.py
- Added/updated tests in tests/unit/test_server.py to cover error handling logic
- Updated documentation in docs/server_setup.md, engineering-mcp-journal-spec-final.md, and scripts/mcp-commit-story-prd.md
- Marked subtask 6.2 as complete in tasks/task_006.txt and tasks/tasks.json

## Accomplishments
- Established a canonical error handling pattern for all MCP tool handlers
- Ensured all errors are returned as status+message dicts, not raw exceptions
- Maintained strict TDD throughout
