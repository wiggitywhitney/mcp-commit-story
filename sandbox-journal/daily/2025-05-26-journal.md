### 2025-05-26 07:02:09 -0500 — Commit 62dcb3f

#### Summary

Scaffolded the MCP server core for mcp-commit-story, including dynamic version loading, config, and stub-aware telemetry integration.

- Followed strict TDD: wrote failing tests for server instantiation, config, and telemetry before implementation; all tests pass after implementation.
- Added user-facing and engineering documentation for server setup and configuration.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Added `src/mcp_commit_story/server.py` with `create_mcp_server()`, `register_tools()`, and version/config/telemetry logic.
- Updated engineering spec and PRD to reflect actual FastMCP API and TDD process.
- Created `docs/server_setup.md` for outside users.
- Tests in `tests/unit/test_server.py` now cover config, version, and telemetry logic.

#### Accomplishments
- Strict TDD cycle completed for server initialization
- Dynamic version loading from pyproject.toml
- Stub-aware telemetry integration
- User-facing documentation for server setup
- Engineering spec and PRD updated for clarity

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- FastMCP does not support startup/shutdown hooks; had to adapt to config/telemetry setup before instantiation

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> TDD process and documentation led to a robust, user-friendly server foundation

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** How do cursor rules compare to the memory mcp server?

> **AI:** Cursor rules are for code/workflow conventions; memory MCP server is a structured, queryable knowledge base for project state and dependencies. They are complementary.

### 2025-05-26 10:03:55 -0500 — Commit 176eb42

#### Summary
- Implemented server startup, shutdown, and configuration logic for the MCP server, including hot config reload and strict required-field validation.
- Followed strict TDD: wrote failing tests for lifecycle management and config validation, clarified requirements, implemented logic, and confirmed all tests pass.
- Updated user docs, PRD, and engineering spec to document hot reload and strict validation features.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Enhanced `src/mcp_commit_story/config.py` and `src/mcp_commit_story/server.py` to support runtime config reload via `reload_config()` and strict validation of required fields.
- Updated `docs/server_setup.md` and `scripts/mcp-commit-story-prd.md` to document new config features and troubleshooting steps.
- Added/updated tests in `tests/unit/test_server.py` to cover startup, reload, and validation logic.
- Modified `tasks/tasks.json` and `tasks/task_006.txt` to mark subtask 6.5 as complete and update dependencies.

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented hot config reload and strict required-field validation for the MCP server
- Maintained strict TDD throughout the development process
- Updated all relevant documentation (user docs, PRD, engineering spec)
- All tests pass for server startup, reload, and config validation

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Required extra iterations to ensure that only explicitly present required fields are accepted (not just filled from defaults)
- Needed to clarify and codify anti-hallucination and test requirements for config validation

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied, with a sense of thoroughness
> The process reinforced the value of strict TDD and robust documentation

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** You stop and ask for my approval more often than I would like. I suspect I have some guidelines about that in cursor rules and/or memory. Will you show them to me? I would like to change them so you move faster
>
> **AI:** There is currently nothing saved in your MCP memory (knowledge graph) about approval, user confirmation, autonomy, or requirements to stop and ask for your approval. No entities or rules about agent workflow cadence or approval pauses are present in your memory.

### 2025-05-26T15:00:44-05:00 — Commit 64b892092feac64abb4ae0c1c64ee48f35fb5a91

#### Summary
Created the main entry point for initializing the MCP Journal system, enabling robust, orchestrated setup in a single function. This unifies validation, config creation, and directory setup, supporting partial recovery and clear error reporting.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added `initialize_journal(repo_path=None, config_path=None, journal_path=None)` to `journal_init.py` as the main orchestrator for journal setup.
- Function validates the git repository, checks for existing config and journal directory, creates missing pieces, and reports status.
- No automatic rollback: any created files/directories are left in place if an error occurs, and the user is informed of what succeeded.
- Updated documentation in `docs/journal_init.md`, PRD, and engineering spec to describe the new function and its usage.
- Added and updated tests in `test_journal_init.py` to cover success, partial failure, already initialized, and error handling scenarios.
- Files changed: docs/journal_init.md, engineering-mcp-journal-spec-final.md, scripts/mcp-commit-story-prd.md, src/mcp_commit_story/journal_init.py, tasks/task_008.txt, tasks/tasks.json, tests/unit/test_journal_init.py

#### Accomplishments
- Unified all initialization logic into a single, testable entry point.
- Improved error handling and user feedback for partial and failed setups.
- Ensured documentation and tests are fully aligned with implementation.
