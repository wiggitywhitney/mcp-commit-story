### 2025-05-26 07:02:09 -0500 — Commit 62dcb3f

#### Summary

Scaffolded the MCP server core for mcp-commit-story, including dynamic version loading, config, and stub-aware telemetry integration.

- Followed strict TDD: wrote failing tests for server instantiation, config, and telemetry before implementation; all tests pass after implementation.
- Added user-facing and engineering documentation for server setup and configuration.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Added `src/mcp_commit_story/server.py` with `create_mcp_server()`, `register_tools()`, and version/config/telemetry logic.
- Updated engineering spec and PRD to reflect actual FastMCP API and TDD process.
- Created `docs/server_setup.md` for outside users.
- Tests in `tests/unit/test_server.py` now cover config, version, and telemetry logic.

#### Accomplishments
- Strict TDD cycle completed for server initialization
- Dynamic version loading from pyproject.toml
- Stub-aware telemetry integration
- User-facing documentation for server setup
- Engineering spec and PRD updated for clarity

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- FastMCP does not support startup/shutdown hooks; had to adapt to config/telemetry setup before instantiation

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> TDD process and documentation led to a robust, user-friendly server foundation

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** How do cursor rules compare to the memory mcp server?

> **AI:** Cursor rules are for code/workflow conventions; memory MCP server is a structured, queryable knowledge base for project state and dependencies. They are complementary.

### 2025-05-26 08:40:12 -0500 — Commit c0bc538

#### Summary
- Updated the project's task structure to align with the MVP plan, ensuring all critical handlers and dependencies are explicitly tracked and prioritized.
- Added new subtasks for MVP-critical operations, clarified dependencies, and created a future-facing task for post-MVP MCP handlers.
- This change improves traceability, planning clarity, and supports a more robust, test-driven workflow for the next development phase.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Modified 5 files: 92 insertions, 14 deletions.
- Major changes:
  - Updated `tasks/tasks.json` to add subtasks 6.7 (journal/init) and 6.8 (journal/install-hook) under Task 6.
  - Updated dependencies for subtask 6.6 to include new subtasks.
  - Changed priorities for Task 8 (Journal Initialization) and Task 14 (Git Hook Installation) to "critical" and noted MVP dependency.
  - Added Task 22 for future MCP server handlers (journal/summarize, blogify, backfill).
  - Generated/updated individual task files: `tasks/task_006.txt`, `tasks/task_008.txt`, `tasks/task_014.txt`, `tasks/task_022.txt`.
- All changes were made using the Taskmaster MCP tool, following the new Cursor rule to avoid direct file edits.

#### Accomplishments
- Ensured all MVP-critical operations are explicitly represented and prioritized in the task system.
- Improved future maintainability by creating a dedicated task for non-MVP MCP handlers.
- Maintained strict TDD and documentation standards throughout the update process.

#### Frustrations / Roadblocks
- Encountered friction due to confusion between terminal and MCP tool usage for task generation; resolved by codifying a Cursor rule to always use the MCP tool.

#### Tone / Mood
- Determined, with a focus on clarity and process improvement. The update reflects a commitment to robust planning and workflow hygiene.

### 2025-05-26 09:25:09 -0500 — Commit c3d982b

#### Summary
- Updated the `collect_ai_terminal_commands` function's docstring to explicitly request both AI terminal commands and built-in execution commands for journal extraction.
- Clarified that only AI-executed commands (not human-run) should be included, improving the accuracy and anti-hallucination compliance of terminal context collection.
- This change further aligns the codebase with the engineering spec's requirements for precise, verifiable context extraction.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Modified `src/mcp_commit_story/context_collection.py`: 15 insertions, 44 deletions.
- Replaced the previous prompt with a new, AI-only-focused docstring.
- The new docstring:
  - Specifies extraction from all AI execution methods (terminal, built-in tools, etc.)
  - Tightens anti-hallucination rules to require direct verification from the session transcript
  - Removes executor attribution and human-run command extraction
- No changes to function logic; this is a documentation and prompt engineering update.

#### Accomplishments
- Improved clarity and precision of terminal context collection requirements for AI journal extraction.
- Reduced ambiguity for future contributors and AI agents regarding what commands to include.
- Maintained strict documentation and prompt engineering standards.

#### Frustrations / Roadblocks
- None encountered; the update was straightforward and improved codebase clarity.

#### Tone / Mood
- Focused and methodical. The update reflects a commitment to robust, verifiable, and anti-hallucination-compliant engineering practices.

### 2025-05-26 10:03:55 -0500 — Commit 176eb42

#### Summary
- Implemented server startup, shutdown, and configuration logic for the MCP server, including hot config reload and strict required-field validation.
- Followed strict TDD: wrote failing tests for lifecycle management and config validation, clarified requirements, implemented logic, and confirmed all tests pass.
- Updated user docs, PRD, and engineering spec to document hot reload and strict validation features.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Enhanced `src/mcp_commit_story/config.py` and `src/mcp_commit_story/server.py` to support runtime config reload via `reload_config()` and strict validation of required fields.
- Updated `docs/server_setup.md` and `scripts/mcp-commit-story-prd.md` to document new config features and troubleshooting steps.
- Added/updated tests in `tests/unit/test_server.py` to cover startup, reload, and validation logic.
- Modified `tasks/tasks.json` and `tasks/task_006.txt` to mark subtask 6.5 as complete and update dependencies.

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented hot config reload and strict required-field validation for the MCP server
- Maintained strict TDD throughout the development process
- Updated all relevant documentation (user docs, PRD, engineering spec)
- All tests pass for server startup, reload, and config validation

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Required extra iterations to ensure that only explicitly present required fields are accepted (not just filled from defaults)
- Needed to clarify and codify anti-hallucination and test requirements for config validation

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied, with a sense of thoroughness
> The process reinforced the value of strict TDD and robust documentation

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** You stop and ask for my approval more often than I would like. I suspect I have some guidelines about that in cursor rules and/or memory. Will you show them to me? I would like to change them so you move faster
>
> **AI:** There is currently nothing saved in your MCP memory (knowledge graph) about approval, user confirmation, autonomy, or requirements to stop and ask for your approval. No entities or rules about agent workflow cadence or approval pauses are present in your memory.
