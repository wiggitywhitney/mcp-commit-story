**Git Commit:** `95cce94` - Documentation Cleanup: Remove Old Database References

---

## Summary

Completed comprehensive documentation cleanup to remove outdated references to the old aiService database system. This commit represents the final step in consolidating documentation to reflect only the current chat integration approach, eliminating confusing historical references and internal terminology from user-facing materials.

## Technical Synopsis

The commit involved systematic removal of aiService.prompts and aiService.generations references across documentation files, replacing them with descriptions of the current Composer-based chat integration system. Updated four major documentation files to describe how the system currently accesses Cursor's chat databases using commit-based time windows rather than the deprecated reconstruction approach.

**Key changes:**
- Rewrote `docs/cursor-database-implementation.md` to focus entirely on current chat integration
- Updated `engineering-mcp-journal-spec-final.md` to remove conversation reconstruction references  
- Cleaned up code comments in `message_extraction.py` to reflect current terminology
- Updated exploration script comments to remove task-specific references

The documentation now presents a cohesive narrative about the current system without mentioning that anything was "updated" or "replaced," following the principle of describing current functionality as if it's the only implementation that ever existed.

## Accomplishments

- ✅ **Complete documentation overhaul**: Successfully removed all references to aiService.prompts and aiService.generations from major documentation files
- ✅ **Architecture clarity**: Simplified complex technical descriptions to focus on user-facing benefits like timestamps, session context, and chronological ordering  
- ✅ **Terminology consistency**: Standardized language to describe "chat integration" and "chat database" rather than internal technical terms
- ✅ **Code comment cleanup**: Updated function docstrings and error messages to use current terminology
- ✅ **Task completion**: Marked subtask 61.12 as complete, advancing the Composer integration milestone

## Frustrations

- **None identified**: This was a straightforward documentation cleanup task with clear objectives and completion criteria
