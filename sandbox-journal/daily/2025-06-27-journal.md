### Summary

Successfully enhanced Task 46.9 implementation planning and consolidated technical research documentation. Moved comprehensive SQLite change detection research from TaskMaster's working directory to permanent project documentation. Updated Task 46.8 to include documentation requirements for the 48-hour optimization behavior. Regenerated task files to ensure coordination between optimization implementation (46.9) and documentation (46.8).

### Technical Synopsis

**Research Documentation Consolidation:**
- Discovered `.taskmaster/docs/research/` directory containing comprehensive SQLite change detection research (11KB, 315 lines)
- Successfully relocated research content to `docs/cursor-db-implementation-notes.md` for permanent reference
- Added implementation decision context explaining why 48-hour file modification time approach was chosen
- Cleaned up TaskMaster working directory to reduce project clutter

**Task 46.9 Implementation Planning Enhancement:**
- Updated Task 46.9 with complete TDD methodology structure matching proven patterns from other subtasks
- Added comprehensive implementation plan with specific test cases, design choices, and implementation steps
- Structured plan includes: write tests first, approved design choices, implement functionality, document and complete
- Maintained pragmatic approach: 48-hour window, in-memory only, no API changes, simple modification time filtering

**Task 46.8 Documentation Requirements Update:**
- Enhanced Task 46.8 to include 48-hour optimization documentation in the API guide
- Added requirement to document recent database filtering performance improvements
- Included specifications for before/after metrics and configuration options
- Ensured coordination between feature implementation (46.9) and documentation (46.8)

**Technical Research Content:**
- Documented 6 different SQLite change detection alternatives evaluated
- Preserved comprehensive analysis of file modification time limitations
- Included implementation examples for internal version tracking, WAL monitoring, row-level timestamps
- Added performance considerations and incremental processing patterns

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/cursor-db-implementation-notes.md`: Created comprehensive technical notes (343 new lines)
- `tasks/task_046.txt`: Updated Task 46.9 with TDD implementation plan (64 new lines)
- `tasks/tasks.json`: Enhanced subtask coordination for optimization and documentation
- Removed: `.taskmaster/` directory cleanup (27 lines removed)

**Implementation Results:** Successfully consolidated technical research, enhanced implementation planning with proven methodology, and established coordination between optimization feature and documentation tasks.

### Accomplishments

✅ **Consolidated comprehensive SQLite research** into permanent project documentation for future reference
✅ **Enhanced Task 46.9 with proven TDD methodology** following successful patterns from other subtasks (46.1-46.7)
✅ **Updated Task 46.8 documentation requirements** to include 48-hour optimization behavior and performance metrics
✅ **Cleaned up TaskMaster working directory** removing temporary research files and reducing project clutter
✅ **Preserved critical implementation context** documenting why file modification time approach was chosen over alternatives
✅ **Established task coordination** ensuring optimization implementation (46.9) and documentation (46.8) work together
✅ **Maintained pragmatic design approach** balancing simplicity with performance improvement for cursor_db package
✅ **Structured implementation plan** with specific test cases, edge cases, and performance benchmarks
✅ **Regenerated task files** ensuring all changes are available across task management interfaces
✅ **Created permanent technical reference** for SQLite change detection methods and performance optimization strategies

### Frustrations

Realizing that TaskMaster created a working directory without explicit awareness - need to monitor tool-generated files
Navigating between different optimization approaches and ensuring the chosen solution remains simple and maintainable
Balancing comprehensive documentation with avoiding over-engineering for what should be a straightforward optimization
Ensuring proper coordination between implementation and documentation tasks without creating unnecessary dependencies

### Discussion Notes

> **Human:** "Begin this session by thoroughly reading the last 2 days' of journal entries to understand what I've been working on. I want to start thinking about 46.9 next - it addresses a problem that I just identified as I was finishing up my last work session"

> **AI:** "I'll read through both journal entries to understand your recent work and then examine Task 46.9..."
> **AI:** [Provides comprehensive summary of June 25-26 work including 7 out of 8 Task 46 subtasks completed]

> **Human:** "Which files got created and/or changed yesterday?"

> **AI:** [Comprehensive breakdown of all files created and modified on June 26th]

> **Human:** "Does it make sense to break up 46.9 into an implementation plan similar to that of other subtasks in 46?"

> **AI:** "Absolutely! Looking at Task 46.9 compared to the other subtasks in Task 46, it definitely makes sense to break it down into a structured implementation plan following the same proven TDD methodology."

> **Human:** "What design decisions are there?"

> **AI:** [Identifies key design decisions for caching strategy, modification time granularity, API changes, etc.]

> **Human:** "Should we do research about whether we can see when a db was last modified?"

> **AI:** [Conducts comprehensive research using TaskMaster research tool, generating 11KB document on SQLite change detection methods]

> **Human:** "What the heck is this? .taskmaster/docs/"

> **AI:** "This directory was automatically generated by TaskMaster when we ran the research operation earlier..."

> **Human:** "Let's move it to a better location..."

> **AI:** [Successfully moves research content to docs/cursor-db-implementation-notes.md with proper context]
