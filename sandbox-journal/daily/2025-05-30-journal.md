#### Summary

Completed Task 4.2 by implementing MCP operation instrumentation decorators for OpenTelemetry tracing. This establishes the foundation for observing MCP operations across the AI → MCP → tool call pipeline with standardized semantic attributes and comprehensive error handling.

#### Technical Synopsis

Implemented `trace_mcp_operation` decorator in `src/mcp_commit_story/telemetry.py` with auto-detection for async/sync functions, semantic attribute conventions using `mcp.*` namespace, and full OpenTelemetry integration. The decorator provides automatic span creation, error recording with propagation, and context propagation for distributed tracing. Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_telemetry.py` with 10 test cases covering synchronous/asynchronous functions, exception handling, span attributes, context propagation, and custom attributes. Updated documentation in `docs/telemetry.md` with API details and usage examples, and enhanced engineering specification with implementation details.

#### Accomplishments

- ✅ Completed full TDD cycle: wrote failing tests first, got design approval, implemented functionality, verified passing tests

- ✅ Implemented `trace_mcp_operation` decorator with approved design choices for semantic attributes, error handling, and async support

- ✅ Achieved 100% test coverage (10/10 tests passing) for all decorator functionality including edge cases

- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation across three locations: docs/telemetry.md, engineering spec, and inline docstrings

- ✅ Established OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for MCP operations with `mcp.*` namespace

- ✅ Implemented proper error handling that records exceptions in spans AND propagates them (never suppresses)

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks

- Initial confusion about subtask ID format when trying to use taskmaster MCP tools - had to manually edit tasks.json files

- Minor iteration needed on the decorator implementation to ensure proper function metadata preservation with `@functools.wraps()`

#### Tone/Mood

> Highly satisfied and productive - methodical execution of TDD approach with clean results

> Clear evidence from expressions like "Perfect!", "Excellent!", "FANTASTIC!" and systematic completion of all requirements

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)

> **Human:** What are these changed files? ohh from integration tests?

> **Agent:** Yes, exactly! Those are from integration tests: `.coverage` is the coverage database file generated by pytest when you run tests with coverage reporting.

> **Human:** please Add .coverage to .gitignore

> **Human:** Awesome! Are we ready for 4.2?

> **Agent:** Let me check what tasks are available first and then show you the implementation plan for Task 4.2 as defined in taskmaster.

> **Human:** If you don't see a reason why not, let's delete tasks.json at the root level. The empty one. Let's mark task 4.1 as complete (double check all the criteria are met first) Then mark 4.2 as in progress then tell me the implementation plan as defined in taskmaster

> **Human:** Let's write tests!

> **Agent:** Great! Let's write tests for Task 4.2 "MCP Operation Instrumentation Decorators". According to the TDD approach in the task details, we need to write failing tests first.

> **Human:** 1

> **Agent:** Perfect! Let me present the design choices for Task 4.2 that need your approval before implementation.

> **Human:** APPROVED - All Design Choices Look Excellent

> **Human:** Wow cool

> **Agent:** Thanks! I'm excited about it too - it's a really solid foundation for observability.

> **Human:** I don't like the analogies, I want it more simple but still in the realm of technical. Perhaps in the future I'll say high-level

> **Agent:** Modified explanation to be more technical and direct, focusing on OpenTelemetry concepts without analogies.

### 2025-05-30 08:36 — Reflection

> **Reflection:**
> I'm still working out what I want summaries to look like. Today I asked for it to have less bolded lists, so there are none, and I don't that's great either. Some considerations are human interest, human readability, AI's ability to use the info later. It will probably require deeper thought later, and I'll cater the format to the topic.

> In Key Accomplishments it said "The documentation reorganization solved a real problem that had been building pressure for weeks." It is funny how it overly dramaticizes a minor inconvience.
> 
> Also yesterday Cote taught me about MCP prompts and I'm wondering whether that is a better way to log a reflection
