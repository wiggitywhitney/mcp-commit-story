#### Summary

Initiated comprehensive planning for MCP tool signaling implementation in git hook worker. Created detailed task breakdown with 6 subtasks covering the transition from placeholder MCP calls to file-based signaling mechanism. This architectural shift enables AI clients to autonomously discover and execute MCP tools for automated journal generation.

#### Technical Synopsis

Established Task 37 with systematic approach to file watcher pattern implementation. Key architectural components include: MCP server entry point (`__main__.py`), signal directory management (`.mcp-commit-story/signals/`), generic tool signal creation replacing `call_mcp_tool()` placeholder, cleanup mechanisms, enhanced commit metadata extraction, and comprehensive integration testing. Each subtask follows TDD methodology with explicit approval gates for design decisions.

#### Accomplishments

- Created comprehensive task 37 breakdown with 6 well-defined subtasks
- Established clear TDD workflow for each implementation phase
- Defined signal file format and directory structure specifications
- Planned MCP server entry point implementation with telemetry integration
- Set up approval gates for critical design decisions to ensure quality
- Documented generic signal creation approach to reduce code duplication
- Integrated cleanup and maintenance planning for production readiness

#### Technical Discussions

- **Signal Format Decision**: Chose JSON format over compressed alternatives for readability and debugging ease during development
- **Generic Tool Approach**: Decided to implement `create_tool_signal()` as single function supporting any MCP tool rather than tool-specific implementations
- **FastMCP Integration**: Planning to leverage existing `create_mcp_server()` function rather than custom MCP implementation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Emphasized never blocking git operations even if signal creation fails

#### Terminal Commands

- `git log -1 --pretty=format:"%H %an %ad %s" --date=iso` - Retrieved commit information for journal generation
- `git show --name-only 069b774` - Analyzed files changed in the commit
- `git show 069b774 --format=fuller` - Examined full commit details and diff content
