# Daily Journal Entries - June 11, 2025

### 6:58 AM — Commit 069b774

#### Summary

Initiated comprehensive planning for MCP tool signaling implementation in git hook worker. Created detailed task breakdown with 6 subtasks covering the transition from placeholder MCP calls to file-based signaling mechanism. This architectural shift enables AI clients to autonomously discover and execute MCP tools for automated journal generation.

#### Technical Synopsis

Established Task 37 with systematic approach to file watcher pattern implementation. Key architectural components include: MCP server entry point (`__main__.py`), signal directory management (`.mcp-commit-story/signals/`), generic tool signal creation replacing `call_mcp_tool()` placeholder, cleanup mechanisms, enhanced commit metadata extraction, and comprehensive integration testing. Each subtask follows TDD methodology with explicit approval gates for design decisions.

#### Accomplishments

- Created comprehensive task 37 breakdown with 6 well-defined subtasks
- Established clear TDD workflow for each implementation phase
- Defined signal file format and directory structure specifications
- Planned MCP server entry point implementation with telemetry integration
- Set up approval gates for critical design decisions to ensure quality
- Documented generic signal creation approach to reduce code duplication
- Integrated cleanup and maintenance planning for production readiness

#### Technical Discussions

- **Signal Format Decision**: Chose JSON format over compressed alternatives for readability and debugging ease during development
- **Generic Tool Approach**: Decided to implement `create_tool_signal()` as single function supporting any MCP tool rather than tool-specific implementations
- **FastMCP Integration**: Planning to leverage existing `create_mcp_server()` function rather than custom MCP implementation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Emphasized never blocking git operations even if signal creation fails

#### Terminal Commands

- `git log -1 --pretty=format:"%H %an %ad %s" --date=iso` - Retrieved commit information for journal generation
- `git show --name-only 069b774` - Analyzed files changed in the commit
- `git show 069b774 --format=fuller` - Examined full commit details and diff content

### 7:05 AM — Reflection

I felt like a noob this morning when I just now realized I can get a development instance of my app going without releasing a full MVP. I discovered I'm just one link away from making it all work locally - I just need to use the git hook to awaken the AI beast to create journal content. So I did some research and made a new task and am prioritizing getting that made today!

### 7:14 AM — Reflection

I have some thoughts about things to explore later. 

1 - having better, machine-readable delineation between journal entries, and making sure the reflections use the same delineation
2 - should journal entries have tags and/or IDs to help AI?
3 - right now reflections are created programatically. Do I want for AI to have a way to see these? It is pretty fun how the chatbot hones in on and repeates some of my more colorful phrases. And nice how the AI can relate my reflection words to my actions. Thinking about it, AI does read my reflections when it creates the daily summaries. So it sees the reflections eventually, just not in the moment.
