#### Summary

Completed a comprehensive documentation reorganization that transformed the project's information architecture from a monolithic engineering specification into a focused, modular documentation system. Created specialized documentation guides, established AI documentation usage patterns through cursor rules, and generated an engaging daily summary example for the README. This work addresses the cognitive overload issues with the 900+ line engineering spec by providing targeted, use-case-specific documentation that both humans and AI can navigate efficiently.

#### Technical Synopsis

- **Documentation Architecture**: Split the massive engineering specification into focused, single-purpose documents in the `docs/` directory: `architecture.md`, `mcp-api-specification.md`, `journal-behavior.md`, and `implementation-guide.md`
- **PRD Refactoring**: Completely rewrote the Product Requirements Document to focus solely on product requirements and user value, removing all technical implementation details that had accumulated over time
- **Cursor Rules Integration**: Created `.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc` to guide AI agents to use focused documentation first before consulting the comprehensive engineering spec, reducing cognitive load and improving development velocity
- **README Enhancement**: Updated the main README with improved technical documentation links and replaced the example daily summary with richer, more engaging content from 2025-05-28 that showcases authentic developer voice and real insights
- **Daily Summary Creation**: Generated `sandbox-journal/summaries/daily/2025-05-28-daily.md` following the established format with developer reflections, discussion highlights, and technical progress organized into accessible and detailed sections

#### Accomplishments
- Successfully decomposed a 900+ line monolithic specification into manageable, focused documentation that serves specific use cases without overwhelming readers

- Established clear AI usage patterns through cursor rules that prioritize efficiency and reduce the cognitive burden of navigating large documents

- Created an engaging README example that demonstrates the tool's value through authentic developer voice, including genuine reflections like "sweet baby jesus" and real insights about project management psychology

- Restored focus to the PRD by removing technical implementation details and returning it to its core purpose of defining product requirements and user value

- Implemented a documentation architecture that scales with the project while maintaining usability for both human developers and AI agents

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- The original engineering specification had grown to unwieldy proportions (900+ lines) that created real usability issues for both development and AI assistance

- Required careful coordination across multiple documentation sources to ensure consistency without creating redundancy or maintenance overhead

- Had to balance comprehensive coverage with usability, ensuring that splitting the documentation didn't lose important cross-references or context

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied and organized (high confidence)
> The work delivered immediate clarity and structure to what had become an overwhelming information architecture. Created sustainable patterns for ongoing documentation management.

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** I've been craving an organize/refresh of this document. Is this meant to be a living doc like I'm using it or was it meant to be more of a springboard?

> **Human:** Should I organize the engineering spec (maybe add a table of contents too), update the documentation instead (I wasn't doing that as I go at first so lots is missing), or both? Or neither, and keep on going as I'm doing and worry about documentation later?

> **Human:** TOC and split, yes. will these new docs live in the docs directory? While doing the split will you also verify that all information is current?

> **Human:** Should we make a cursor rule that tells AI to use the focused docs in /docs and then check engineering spec as a backup?

> **Human:** Yes please refactor the PRD

> **Human:** Some feedback: don't just say MCP-server. There are several being used. Taskmaster? The journal MCP server being developed? It is confusing

> **Human:** The documentation refresh didn't happen yesterday. You totally made that up. Please 100% pull only from the 05-28-journal file. DO NOT HALLUCINATE, make sure everything is grounded in fact

### 2025-05-29 07:53 — Reflection

> **Reflection:**
> I'm psyched about how the journal entries and summaries are shaping up. I like when more from chat is included in the "Discussion notes" section. 
> 
> I like the fake daily summary of yesterday's work, especially when it caught the decision point that the CLI refactor "reflects the insight that journal operations require AI analysis that humans cannot meaningfully perform manually", although I wish it understood that was more meaningful to capture than, say, the Taskmaster refactor which it went on and on about. 
> 
> Regarding yesterday's summary I also like how the intersting chat moments were featured, that was fun to see, and felt kind of nice to see all of my more insightful moments from yesterday all at once. Morale boost!
> 
> I don't like all the lists and bolded topics. I also think overall the document is quite redundant, and it over-emphasises some things and under-emphasises others. This could be related to the frequency of my git commits. Activity that happens as part of a bigger commit is probably underrepresented while activity in a small commit is likely overrepresented. 
> 
> I'm capturing this to be helpful for my future self when I'm designing what a daily summary should look like.
