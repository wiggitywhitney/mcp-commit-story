# 2025-06-12 Engineering Journal

**Git Commit**: a8497e3

## Summary

A focused documentation day dedicated to fixing misleading language across the project and accurately describing the signal-based workflow architecture. The commit "Think through UX for signal-based workflow and update plan and documentation with new approach" addressed critical inconsistencies where documentation claimed the system worked "automatically" and "silently in the background" when it actually requires manual user triggers to process signals created by git commits.

## Technical Synopsis

**Core Problem**: Documentation contained misleading language that promised automatic journal generation when the actual implementation uses a signal-based workflow requiring manual user intervention.

**Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive documentation update across 6 key files (README.md, engineering spec, architecture docs, PRD, etc.) replacing "automatic" language with accurate descriptions of the signal-based approach.

**Key Changes**:
- README.md: Updated "How Does It Work?" section to lead with signal-based workflow explanation
- Architecture docs: Replaced "Automated Journaling" with "Signal-Based Journaling" complete with workflow diagrams
- PRD: Fixed core value proposition from "works silently in the background" to accurate signal description
- Engineering spec: Added signal-based workflow context to the overview
- Implementation guide and discovery docs: Removed automatic language throughout

**TaskMaster Integration**: Added two new tasks (38: Signal Processing Tool, 39: AI Synthesized Context Collection) while removing task 40 (documentation updates) since those were completed immediately.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Documentation Accuracy**: Fixed fundamental misalignment between documented behavior and actual system architecture
- **User Experience Clarity**: Eliminated confusion about system automation by truthfully describing the manual trigger workflow
- **Architectural Honesty**: Documentation now accurately reflects that git commits create signals for later processing rather than immediate AI action
- **Task Planning Enhancement**: Added critical missing components (signal processing tool, synthesized context collection) to the project roadmap
- **Complete Documentation Sweep**: Updated 6 major documentation files and the PRD to maintain consistency

## Challenges and Frustrations

**Documentation Debt**: Discovered that a significant portion of the project documentation was fundamentally misleading about the core user experience, requiring extensive updates across multiple files.

**Architectural Reality vs. Marketing**: Had to balance the desire for "magical" automatic functionality with the technical reality that AI assistants can't monitor filesystem changes or run background processes.

**Scope Creep Prevention**: Initially planned to create a separate task for documentation updates but decided to handle them immediately to prevent the documentation debt from growing larger.

## Tone and Mood

Methodical and corrective. The work had a "cleanup" quality - fixing fundamental issues that could mislead users about how the system actually works. There was satisfaction in bringing documentation into alignment with reality, even though it meant acknowledging limitations in the automation story.

The approach was pragmatic: rather than trying to make the system more automatic, embrace the signal-based workflow as a feature that gives users control over when AI processing happens.

## Discussion Highlights

**Key Architectural Insight**: "Git Hook → AI Journal Entry Integration: Problems and Solutions Summary" - comprehensive analysis of why direct AI awakening doesn't work and why signal-based approach is the viable solution.

**Documentation Philosophy**: Decision to be truthful about the manual trigger requirement rather than overselling automation capabilities.

**TaskMaster Strategy**: Recognition that task 38 (Signal Processing Tool) is the critical missing piece to complete the signal-based architecture.

## Terminal Commands and Operations

- Git operations: `git commit -m "Think through UX for signal-based workflow and update plan and documentation with new approach"`
- File modifications across documentation ecosystem
- TaskMaster operations: Added tasks 38-39, removed task 40

### 8:35 AM — Reflection

I'm disappointed that the git hook trigger system won't work, and disappointed that I didn't realize that AI chat can't be programatically triggered until this late in the game. Both models (Claude and ChatGPT) lied to me a long time ago and I feel I've been building a castle on unstable ground. I'm shaken and I'm hoping that no other major design flaws surface - I truly have been trying to root out problems in any way I can think of. Failing fast is easer said than done!

The signal-based approach is okay and I do like that users won't have their workflow interruped with journal entry creations - they can decide for themselves when is a good moment to make entries. A signal file seems kind of clunky and gross though, tbh. I don't love having implementation details exposed to users, and it probably has some security problems. Whatever, it is what it is. 

I have a lot of thoughts about my 4 context collection signals, this area needs to be hugely revamped given this new approach: 

**Git context** - this is good as-is

**AI chat collection** - the full chat collection can happen programatically as per task 36 (hopefully). But then somehow, somewhere AI needs to intelligently parse the relevant chat for a particular journal entry by using the git code/file changes as a guide

**AI chat context** - there is a "synthesised chat summary" available by simply asking AI for it, and I think it will strengthen entries. However now with the signal file system there might be a time delay between when a git commit is created and when it is processed into a journal entry. The longer that delay is, the less relevant the AI chat context is, and that context could possibly become confusing/detrimental instead of helpful. Logic needs to be added for not only how to collect it, but when it gets used. 

**AI terminal commands** - I'm wondering whether these are helpful at all. They seem shallow and usually related only to tests. I'd like to explore the idea of omitting them altogether but for now at least, it is easier just to keep them as-is.

### 8:41 AM — Reflection

One idea is to collect AI context at git hook time and process it later at journal entry creation time. I've been trying like hell to avoid holding/managing state though. I'll think about this more later.
