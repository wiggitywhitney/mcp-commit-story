#### Summary
Formalized and documented all context collection data structures for the journal entry system. Introduced explicit TypedDicts for chat, terminal, and git context, ensuring type safety and clarity throughout the codebase. Updated tests, engineering spec, and PRD to reference the new unified context model. This foundational work sets the stage for robust, type-checked section generators and future maintainability.

#### Accomplishments
- Defined TypedDicts for ChatMessage, ChatHistory, TerminalCommand, TerminalContext, GitMetadata, GitContext, and JournalContext
- Updated all context collection functions to use and return the new types
- Added and updated tests to enforce type correctness
- Updated engineering spec and PRD with unified context model and code examples
- Updated docstrings and comments to reference new types and ephemeral context rule
- Ran Taskmaster tools to propagate changes to all tasks and subtasks

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor friction aligning all docstrings and comments with the new model
- Ensuring all downstream tasks and tests referenced the correct types

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures"
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Should we use a unified context type for all section generators?
> **Agent:** Yes, a JournalContext TypedDict will improve type safety and maintainability.
> **Human:** Let's update the engineering spec and PRD to reflect this.
> **Agent:** Both documents now include a section on the unified context model and TypedDicts.

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> The codebase is now more robust and future-proof, with clear type boundaries and documentation.

### 2025-05-24  — Commit c1204e6

#### Summary
Implemented the `generate_summary_section` function using the canonical AI-driven pattern, with the full prompt in the docstring and a placeholder return value. This aligns the summary section generator with the project's architectural standards for AI-driven context and section generation. The implementation does not yet include tests using mock data, which will be addressed in the next subtask.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added `generate_summary_section` to `journal.py` with the canonical AI prompt as its docstring.
- Ensured the function returns a `SummarySection` placeholder, matching the Pattern 1 approach.
- No logic or AI calls are performed in the function body; the AI agent is expected to execute the prompt.
- Updated documentation and tests to reflect this pattern.
- The implementation sets the stage for robust, testable, and anti-hallucination-compliant section generation.

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented the summary section generator with canonical AI prompt and placeholder return.
- Updated the README and code comments to document the Pattern 1 approach.
- Restructured tests to expect placeholder returns in local/dev runs.
- Ensured all local tests pass after restructuring.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- The need to restructure tests to accommodate the AI-driven pattern required careful coordination between code, tests, and documentation.
- The actual narrative/content generation is deferred until mock data and AI-integration tests are in place.

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Implement generate_summary_section except for tests using mock data"
# (plus test runs, file edits, and documentation updates)
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** The summary section generator should use the canonical AI-driven pattern, with the prompt in the docstring and a placeholder return.
> **Agent:** Agreed. This approach ensures consistency, leverages the AI's conversational context, and simplifies testing and future development.
> **Human:** We'll handle tests using mock data in the next subtask.

#### Tone/Mood
> Methodical and forward-looking
> The implementation aligns with architectural standards and sets up the next phase of TDD with mock data.
