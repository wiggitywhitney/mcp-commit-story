#### Summary
Formalized and documented all context collection data structures for the journal entry system. Introduced explicit TypedDicts for chat, terminal, and git context, ensuring type safety and clarity throughout the codebase. Updated tests, engineering spec, and PRD to reference the new unified context model. This foundational work sets the stage for robust, type-checked section generators and future maintainability.

#### Accomplishments
- Defined TypedDicts for ChatMessage, ChatHistory, TerminalCommand, TerminalContext, GitMetadata, GitContext, and JournalContext
- Updated all context collection functions to use and return the new types
- Added and updated tests to enforce type correctness
- Updated engineering spec and PRD with unified context model and code examples
- Updated docstrings and comments to reference new types and ephemeral context rule
- Ran Taskmaster tools to propagate changes to all tasks and subtasks

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor friction aligning all docstrings and comments with the new model
- Ensuring all downstream tasks and tests referenced the correct types

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures"
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Should we use a unified context type for all section generators?
> **Agent:** Yes, a JournalContext TypedDict will improve type safety and maintainability.
> **Human:** Let's update the engineering spec and PRD to reflect this.
> **Agent:** Both documents now include a section on the unified context model and TypedDicts.

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> The codebase is now more robust and future-proof, with clear type boundaries and documentation.
