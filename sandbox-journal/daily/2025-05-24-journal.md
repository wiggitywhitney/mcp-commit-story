### 2025-05-24 13:36 PM — Commit 810db78

#### Summary
Formalized and documented all context collection data structures for the journal entry system. Introduced explicit TypedDicts for chat, terminal, and git context, ensuring type safety and clarity throughout the codebase. Updated tests, engineering spec, and PRD to reference the new unified context model. This foundational work sets the stage for robust, type-checked section generators and future maintainability.

#### Accomplishments
- Defined TypedDicts for ChatMessage, ChatHistory, TerminalCommand, TerminalContext, GitMetadata, GitContext, and JournalContext
- Updated all context collection functions to use and return the new types
- Added and updated tests to enforce type correctness
- Updated engineering spec and PRD with unified context model and code examples
- Updated docstrings and comments to reference new types and ephemeral context rule
- Ran Taskmaster tools to propagate changes to all tasks and subtasks

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor friction aligning all docstrings and comments with the new model
- Ensuring all downstream tasks and tests referenced the correct types

### 2025-05-24  — Commit c1204e6

#### Summary
Implemented the `generate_summary_section` function using the canonical AI-driven pattern, with the full prompt in the docstring and a placeholder return value. This aligns the summary section generator with the project's architectural standards for AI-driven context and section generation. The implementation does not yet include tests using mock data, which will be addressed in the next subtask.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added `generate_summary_section` to `journal.py` with the canonical AI prompt as its docstring.
- Ensured the function returns a `SummarySection` placeholder, matching the Pattern 1 approach.
- No logic or AI calls are performed in the function body; the AI agent is expected to execute the prompt.
- Updated documentation and tests to reflect this pattern.
- The implementation sets the stage for robust, testable, and anti-hallucination-compliant section generation.

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented the summary section generator with canonical AI prompt and placeholder return.
- Updated the README and code comments to document the Pattern 1 approach.
- Restructured tests to expect placeholder returns in local/dev runs.
- Ensured all local tests pass after restructuring.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- The need to restructure tests to accommodate the AI-driven pattern required careful coordination between code, tests, and documentation.
- The actual narrative/content generation is deferred until mock data and AI-integration tests are in place.

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Implement generate_summary_section except for tests using mock data"
# (plus test runs, file edits, and documentation updates)
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** The summary section generator should use the canonical AI-driven pattern, with the prompt in the docstring and a placeholder return.
> **Agent:** Agreed. This approach ensures consistency, leverages the AI's conversational context, and simplifies testing and future development.
> **Human:** We'll handle tests using mock data in the next subtask.

#### Tone/Mood
> Methodical and forward-looking
> The implementation aligns with architectural standards and sets up the next phase of TDD with mock data.

### 2025-05-24 17:15 — Commit bbed7d1

#### Summary
Created comprehensive test fixtures and mock data for section generators, enabling robust TDD for AI-driven journal entry sections. This work also reorganized and updated the journal entry structure to reflect the new canonical section order and renamed "Behind the Commit" to "Commit Metadata". These changes lay the groundwork for reliable, context-rich, and anti-hallucination-compliant section generation moving forward.

#### Technical Synopsis
- Added `tests/fixtures/summary_test_data.py` with reusable mock context functions for edge cases (explicit purpose, evolution, unkind language, no chat, etc.)
- Updated `test_journal_entry.py` and `test_journal.py` to use new fixtures and expect AI-driven Pattern 1 returns
- Marked AI-dependent tests as xfail for local/dev runs, clarifying integration test boundaries
- Refactored `JournalEntry.to_markdown()` to output sections in the new canonical order
- Renamed all references to "Behind the Commit" as "Commit Metadata" in code, docs, and tasks
- Updated engineering spec and PRD to match new structure and naming
- Updated and marked Taskmaster subtasks for mock data and section ordering as done

#### Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive, reusable mock data for all section generator edge cases
- Updated all tests to use fixtures and expect correct placeholder or AI-driven returns
- Refactored journal entry output and documentation to match the new canonical structure
- Ensured all local/dev tests pass and AI-dependent tests are clearly marked
- Improved maintainability and clarity for future section generator work

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Required careful coordination across code, tests, documentation, and task files to ensure consistency
- Some friction updating all references to the renamed section and new order

#### Tone/Mood
> Thorough and detail-oriented
> The changes required broad updates but resulted in a much more maintainable and testable codebase

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** I want to create comprehensive mock data and fixtures for all section generators, and update the journal entry structure to match the new canonical order.
> **Agent:** This is an excellent foundation for robust TDD and anti-hallucination testing. The new structure and naming are now reflected everywhere.
> **Human:** Please mark the mock data subtask as done and update all references to the new section order and naming.
