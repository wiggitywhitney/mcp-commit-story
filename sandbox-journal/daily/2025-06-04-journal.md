### 2025-06-04 â€” Commit 6785c6a

#### Summary

Added comprehensive MCP best practices tasks to the Taskmaster system to ensure production readiness and compliance with MCP client requirements. Created seven new tasks (28-34) organized into pre-MVP blocking tasks and post-MVP improvement tasks, with proper dependency structures to guide implementation priority. This strategic addition addresses critical concerns about stdout pollution, logging infrastructure, performance validation, and code maintainability for a production-ready MCP tool.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Created Task 28: File-Based Logging System (high priority, no dependencies) to replace Python standard logging with JSON file logging to prevent MCP client interference
- Created Task 29: MCP Info Command (high priority, depends on 28) for diagnostic capabilities and troubleshooting support
- Created Task 30: Release Preparation Script (high priority, no dependencies) for automated quality checks before publishing
- Created Task 31: Refactor Large Modules (medium priority, depends on 26) to split files >500 LOC per MCP best practices
- Created Task 32: Parameter Parsing Leniency (low priority, depends on 26) for flexible MCP handler parameter variations
- Created Task 33: Remove All Console Output (medium priority, depends on 28,26) to audit and eliminate stdout pollution
- Created Task 34: Performance Validation (critical priority, depends on 9,27) for continuous commit-based performance monitoring
- Updated Task 26 (MVP Launch) dependencies to include new pre-MVP tasks [9,27,28,29,30]

#### Accomplishments
- Structured a comprehensive approach to MCP production readiness with clear pre/post-MVP separation

- Established proper task dependencies to ensure critical infrastructure (logging, diagnostics) is built before MVP launch

- Created a performance validation system that will provide continuous feedback on the journal generation architecture

- Addressed key MCP client compatibility concerns proactively rather than reactively

- Organized tasks by priority and impact to guide development focus effectively

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Recognized the tension between thoroughness and scope creep - adding these tasks significantly expands the work required for MVP

- Felt concerned about potentially over-engineering the solution when simple fixes might suffice

- Struggled with balancing MCP best practices compliance against rapid MVP delivery goals

#### Tone/Mood
> Strategic but apprehensive (medium confidence)
> Created a solid roadmap for production readiness but worried about expanding scope beyond what's actually needed for a functional MVP.

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Create New MCP Best Practices Tasks for Taskmaster... I need you to create multiple new tasks in our task management system to implement MCP best practices. These should be broken into pre-MVP (blocking) and post-MVP (improvements) tasks with proper dependencies.

> **AI:** I'll help you create these comprehensive MCP best practices tasks in Taskmaster. Let me start by checking the current project state and then systematically add each of these well-defined tasks.

> **Human:** tbh I'm worried that I just gave myself a ton of extra work

> **AI:** You're absolutely right to be concerned! Let me help you see what's actually essential vs. what we can simplify or defer. Looking at what you just created, some of this is definitely overkill for an MVP.
