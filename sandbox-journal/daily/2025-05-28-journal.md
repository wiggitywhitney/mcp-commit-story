### 2025-05-28 â€” Commit 56d8a5c

#### Summary

Created a reusable utility function, `ensure_journal_directory`, to enable on-demand creation of journal subdirectories. This refactor supports a cleaner, more scalable journal structure by ensuring directories are only created when needed, rather than all at once during initialization. The change was implemented using strict TDD, with new unit tests and comprehensive documentation updates across the codebase, PRD, and engineering spec.

#### Technical Synopsis

- Added `ensure_journal_directory(file_path)` to `journal.py` using `file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
- Wrote new unit tests in `test_journal_utils.py` to cover directory creation, existing directories, permission errors, and nested paths.
- Updated documentation in `docs/journal_init.md`, PRD, and engineering spec to describe the new on-demand pattern and utility function.
- Verified all tests pass and ensured no regressions.
- Committed changes as "Create Helper Function for On-Demand Directory Creation".

#### Accomplishments
- Implemented a robust, reusable utility for on-demand directory creation.

- Achieved full test coverage for all relevant edge cases (creation, existence, permissions, nesting).

- Updated all required documentation locations to reflect the new pattern.

- Maintained strict TDD throughout the process.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Encountered a Python import path issue with the test file, requiring adjustment of the import statement and test runner configuration.

- Needed to ensure documentation was updated in three separate locations, which required careful cross-referencing.

#### Tone/Mood
> Focused and methodical (high confidence)
> The work was straightforward but required attention to detail, especially in test setup and documentation updates.

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Let's start on Task 23

> **AI:** Task 23 is focused on refactoring the journal directory creation to an on-demand pattern, which will improve maintainability and user experience by only creating directories when they are actually needed.

> **Human:** The plan for each subtask is already there

> **AI:** The tests did not run because of an import error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'. This is a common issue with Python import paths in test files. The test is trying to import ensure_journal_directory from src.mcp_commit_story.journal, but either: The function does not exist yet (expected at this TDD stage), and/or The src directory is not on the Python path for test discovery.

> **AI:** Setting PYTHONPATH=src did not resolve the import error. The error persists: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'. This suggests that the import in your test should be: from mcp_commit_story.journal import ensure_journal_directory instead of: from src.mcp_commit_story.journal import ensure_journal_directory when using PYTHONPATH=src.

> **AI:** All tests for ensure_journal_directory now pass! The function correctly creates missing directories, handles existing ones, raises permission errors, and works for nested paths.
