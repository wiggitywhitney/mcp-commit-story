# Daily Summary - May 29, 2025

## Summary

**Added telemetry and monitoring to track how well the journal generation system is working in practice**

May 29th implemented telemetry collection to understand system performance and AI quality. The telemetry tracks metrics like how long journal generation takes, how often AI calls fail, what types of context are most valuable, and user satisfaction with generated content. This data helps optimize the system and identify when AI prompts need adjustment. The telemetry includes privacy controls and can be disabled for users who prefer not to share usage data.

May 29th was a refinement and optimization day focused on enhancing the MCP server implementation and preparing for production deployment. The work progressed from improving MCP tool reliability and performance to implementing comprehensive telemetry and monitoring capabilities.
