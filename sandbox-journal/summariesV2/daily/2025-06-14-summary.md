# Daily Summary - June 14, 2025

## Reflections

### 6:15 AM — Reflection

I'm a bit overwhelmed by the refactor and by how much of this is in my head and not in Taskmaster or the repo, except for current journal entries

The thing to focus on now is making the journal entries, then I'll worry about the rest. So 

1 - Make chat collection work

2 - Make a function that intelligently knows which chat information to parse based on git diff (and other git info)

2 - Refactor the journal entry generator function (and orchestration layer?) that is triggered by git hook. It should take in three things: (1) git context, (2) relevant AI chat history and (3) today's journal entries if there are any, and perhaps the most recent 2 days' worth or something

I do think there should be some sort of high-level project overview (like the project's README?) that the brand-new AI gets as input each time too.

Then the funciton outputs a journal entry that is human readable but also tagged and machine readable for future AI parsing

This function is NOT an MCP tool and it will run silently in the background. Again triggered by git hook, and so are the summaries. 

The function will invoke a brand-new AI instance that has no awareness of current project context except for what it is given

3 - This will happen later, but creating a new MCP tool journal/capture-context will be a high priority. 
The idea is that the user can manually run journal/capture-context and, because the journal entry generator function reads recent journal files,  that context will make its way to the brand new AI that generates the entries

### 6:45 AM — Reflection

After that last reflection I went down a rabbit hole, converting my thoughts into Taskmaster tasks. I *think* I have a path to MVP captured. Except I'd like to refactor the daily summary function to use the the new type of background, non-MCP generation... I'd consider that part of MVP. 

I feel better now that I'm more organized. And even though I got down about the git hook not being able to trigger the Cursor AI agent, ultimately I think the refactor makes for a stronger and better system. 

The only thing that could stop me now is if I can't produce the journal entry quality that I'm after without the Cursor AI's current context. But even then, I'm empowering the human user to add it. 

I'm excited. ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و
