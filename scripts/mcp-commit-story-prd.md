# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## MCP Commit Story - Engineering Journal Tool

---

## **Product Overview**

**MCP Commit Story** is an automated engineering journal tool that captures the story behind code commits. It transforms development work into narrative entries that can be used for retrospectives, career documentation, and content creation.

### **Core Value Proposition**
- **Capture context**: Record not just what was built, but how it felt and why it mattered
- **Enable storytelling**: Transform development work into content for blogs, talks, and retrospectives  
- **Support growth**: Help developers reflect on and document their professional journey
- **Zero friction**: Work silently in the background, triggered by normal git workflow

---

## **Target Users**

### **Primary User: Individual Developer**
- Works with git repositories
- Values reflection and professional growth
- Creates content (blogs, talks, documentation)
- Participates in team retrospectives and performance reviews

### **Secondary Users**
- **Team Leads**: Use journal insights for retrospectives and team development
- **Engineering Managers**: Support career development conversations with concrete examples
- **Developer Advocates**: Mine authentic stories for technical content

## **Core User Stories**

### **As a Developer, I want to:**
1. **Automatically capture my development story** so I don't lose the context behind my work
2. **Remember why I made technical decisions** weeks or months later
3. **Have concrete examples for performance reviews** without manually tracking accomplishments
4. **Find authentic stories for blog posts and talks** based on real development experiences
5. **Reflect on my growth over time** through patterns in my work and challenges

### **As a Team Lead, I want to:**
1. **Access rich context for retrospectives** beyond just what shipped
2. **Understand team challenges and blockers** through authentic development experiences
3. **Support career development conversations** with concrete examples of growth and impact

- **Yearly summaries**: Career development, skill evolution, major projects
- **Manual reflections**: Support for adding manual reflections to journal entries that are prioritized in summaries for enhanced context and developer insights

#### **Content Quality Standards**
- **No hallucination**: All content must be grounded in actual data (commits, chat, commands)
- **Authentic tone**: Capture the developer's actual mood and language from available context
- **Decision transparency**: Include reasoning when available, acknowledge uncertainty when not
- **Respectful privacy**: Only process data that developers explicitly make available

### **User Experience Requirements**

#### **Setup Experience**
- **Simple initialization**: One command to set up in a repository

- **Graceful degradation**: Works even when some data sources unavailable

#### **Content Discovery Experience**
- **Logical organization**: Easy to find entries by date or time period
- **Readable format**: Clean markdown that works in any editor
- **Portable content**: Files can be shared, exported, or processed by other tools

### **Technical Integration Requirements**

#### **Git Integration**
- **Hook-based triggering**: Automatic execution via git post-commit hook
- **Repository awareness**: Understand git context and changes
- **Multi-repo support**: Each repository maintains its own journal

#### **AI Assistant Integration**
- **MCP protocol**: Expose functionality via Model Context Protocol
- **Chat context awareness**: Access to AI assistant conversation history when available
- **Command tracking**: Capture AI-executed commands when available

#### **Development Environment Compatibility**
- **Cross-platform**: Work on macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Editor agnostic**: No dependency on specific development tools
- **Version control friendly**: Journal files work well with git

#### **Observability and Monitoring**
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Comprehensive telemetry integration**: Complete OpenTelemetry-based observability system integrated throughout the MCP server lifecycle and journal operations
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: End-to-end tracing**: Distributed traces capture the complete journey from MCP tool call initiation through journal generation, AI processing, and file writing operations
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Real-time metrics collection**: Automatic collection of tool call counts, durations, success/failure rates, file operation metrics, AI generation timing, and system performance metrics
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Structured logging with trace correlation**: JSON-formatted logs automatically enhanced with OpenTelemetry trace and span IDs for seamless debugging
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Multi-environment telemetry support**: Production-ready configuration with console output for development and OTLP export for production observability backends
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Graceful degradation**: System continues operating normally even when telemetry infrastructure fails, ensuring reliability
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Performance monitoring**: Sub-5ms overhead per operation with comprehensive timing and resource utilization tracking
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: MCP-specific observability**: Dedicated metrics for tool call patterns, client attribution (Cursor, Claude Desktop), and operation success rates
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Security-conscious logging**: Automatic redaction of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens, git info, URLs, personal data) from all log output with configurable debug mode for development
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Health monitoring**: Built-in health checks for telemetry system status and integration verification
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Hot configuration reload**: Update telemetry settings without restarting the MCP server
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Production deployment ready**: Configurable exporters supporting Jaeger, DataDog, New Relic, Prometheus, and custom observability backends
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Journal operations instrumentation**: Complete observability for all journal management operations including file operations, AI generation, directory creation, context loading, and entry parsing
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Context collection telemetry**: Comprehensive instrumentation for Git operations (diff, log, status) and context gathering (chat history, terminal commands) with performance optimization, memory tracking, and smart file sampling for large repositories
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Async/sync operation support**: Telemetry decorator automatically handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions for comprehensive coverage
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Advanced sensitive data filtering**: Multi-layer protection with production and debug modes, handling git information, authentication data, connection strings, and personal information
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Integration test telemetry validation**: Comprehensive test framework validates telemetry functionality across MCP tool execution chains, AI generation pipelines, and production scenarios with automated circuit breaker and performance impact testing

- **Team aggregation features**: Combine individual journals for team insights
- **Integration plugins**: Connections to project management tools
- **Advanced analytics**: Pattern recognition across time and projects
- **Export formats**: PDF, HTML, or other formats for sharing

## **Technical Constraints**

### **Platform Requirements**
- **Python 3.9+**: Minimum runtime requirement
- **Git repository**: Must be used within a git-managed project
- **Local file system**: Requires write access to repository directory

### **Integration Constraints**
- **MCP protocol compliance**: Must work with MCP-compatible AI assistants
- **No external dependencies**: Core functionality works without internet
- **Minimal resource usage**: Should not impact development performance

### **Privacy and Security**
- **Local data only**: No automatic external transmission of journal content
- **Developer control**: Clear boundaries on what data is collected and how
- **Opt-out capability**: Easy to disable or remove
