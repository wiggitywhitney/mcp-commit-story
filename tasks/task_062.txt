# Task ID: 62
# Title: Implement Multi-Session Chat Extraction Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the chat extraction system to query and merge conversations from multiple workspace databases, ensuring complete journal entries when work spans across different chat sessions.
# Details:
This task involves modifying the chat extraction pipeline to capture conversations across multiple database files when work spans several chat sessions:

1. Refactor `query_cursor_chat_database()` to utilize `discover_all_cursor_databases()` instead of only querying a single workspace database.
2. Implement a mechanism to query all workspace databases that fall within the commit time window:
   - Identify all relevant database files using `discover_all_cursor_databases()`
   - Filter databases based on timestamp metadata to match commit timeframe
   - Execute queries against all matching databases

3. Develop a merging algorithm to combine results from multiple databases:
   - Sort all conversation entries chronologically
   - Handle potential duplicates across databases
   - Preserve conversation threading and context

4. Maintain backward compatibility:
   - Ensure the API interface remains unchanged
   - Make the multi-database querying transparent to calling code
   - Preserve existing behavior for single-database scenarios

5. Optimize performance:
   - Implement parallel querying where appropriate
   - Add caching mechanisms to prevent redundant database access
   - Monitor and optimize query execution time to minimize impact on git hooks

6. Handle edge cases:
   - Overlapping chat sessions
   - Databases with inconsistent timestamps
   - Missing or corrupted database files
   - Proper ordering when timestamps are identical

7. Update documentation to reflect the enhanced capabilities of the chat extraction system.

Code changes will primarily focus on:
- `query_cursor_chat_database()` function
- `ComposerChatProvider` class
- Database query and result processing logic

# Test Strategy:
The implementation will be verified through a comprehensive testing approach:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create mock database files with different chat sessions
   - Verify correct discovery of all relevant database files
   - Test the merging algorithm with various scenarios (overlapping conversations, identical timestamps)
   - Validate deduplication logic works correctly

2. Integration Tests:
   - Set up a test environment with multiple database files spanning different time periods
   - Simulate a commit that spans multiple chat sessions
   - Verify all relevant conversations are extracted and merged correctly
   - Confirm chronological ordering of merged results

3. Performance Tests:
   - Benchmark query execution time with varying numbers of database files (1, 3, 5, 10)
   - Ensure performance remains within acceptable thresholds for git hook execution
   - Test with large database files to identify potential bottlenecks

4. Edge Case Tests:
   - Test with corrupted or incomplete database files
   - Verify behavior with overlapping chat sessions
   - Test with extreme time ranges (very short and very long commits)
   - Validate handling of databases with identical timestamps

5. Regression Tests:
   - Ensure existing functionality works correctly for single-database scenarios
   - Verify API compatibility with existing code
   - Confirm no regressions in related features

6. Manual Testing:
   - Create a real-world scenario with work spanning multiple chat sessions
   - Execute a commit and verify the journal entry contains all relevant conversations
