# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate an AI-powered context synthesis system as the fourth source in the context collection framework, capturing workspace understanding, session meta-context, and contextual awareness beyond chat messages.
# Details:
## Implementation Overview
This task involves creating a sophisticated AI-driven context synthesis system that will serve as the fourth pillar in our context collection framework, complementing the existing git, chat, and terminal context sources.

## Phase 1: AI Prompt Engineering
1. Design a set of specialized prompts that can:
   - Extract high-level understanding of the current workspace state
   - Synthesize development session meta-context
   - Identify relationships between code components
   - Capture developer intent and workflow patterns
2. Create a prompt template system that can be dynamically adjusted based on:
   - Current project type and technology stack
   - Recent development activities
   - Detected patterns in coding behavior

## Phase 2: Context Collection Function
1. Implement `collectSynthesizedContext()` function that:
   - Takes inputs from other context sources (git, chat, terminal)
   - Applies the engineered prompts to an AI model
   - Processes and structures the AI responses
   - Returns a rich contextual understanding object
2. Optimize prompt execution to minimize latency:
   - Implement caching for similar contexts
   - Use streaming responses where appropriate
   - Consider batching context requests

## Phase 3: Integration with Context Collection System
1. Modify the main context collection pipeline to include the new AI synthesized source:
   ```typescript
   async function collectAllContext() {
     const [gitContext, chatContext, terminalContext, synthesizedContext] = await Promise.all([
       collectGitContext(),
       collectChatContext(),
       collectTerminalContext(),
       collectSynthesizedContext() // New fourth source
     ]);
     
     return {
       git: gitContext,
       chat: chatContext,
       terminal: terminalContext,
       synthesized: synthesizedContext // New context type
     };
   }
   ```
2. Update context merging and prioritization logic to incorporate synthesized insights
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for when AI synthesis is unavailable or low quality

## Phase 4: Context Enhancement Features
1. Develop specialized extractors for different context types:
   - Workspace context: project structure, file relationships, architecture patterns
   - Session context: current development flow, task switching patterns
   - Code context: semantic understanding of code beyond syntax
   - Meta-context: developer intent, problem-solving approaches
2. Create a context scoring system to prioritize most relevant synthesized insights

## Phase 5: Journal Entry Enrichment
1. Modify journal entry generation to leverage synthesized context:
   - Include AI-generated summaries of development sessions
   - Highlight key insights about code changes and their purpose
   - Provide higher-level abstractions of development activities
2. Implement configurable verbosity levels for synthesized context in journal entries

# Test Strategy:
## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
1. Create unit tests for the `collectSynthesizedContext()` function:
   - Test with various mock inputs from other context sources
   - Verify correct prompt construction and AI request formatting
   - Validate proper handling of AI response parsing
   - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. Test context integration:
   - Verify synthesized context is correctly merged with other context sources
   - Test prioritization logic when contexts overlap or conflict
   - Ensure performance remains acceptable with the additional context source

### Integration Tests
1. End-to-end testing of the complete context collection pipeline:
   - Verify all four context sources are collected and integrated properly
   - Test with various real-world development scenarios
   - Measure and optimize performance impact

2. Journal entry generation tests:
   - Verify synthesized context appears appropriately in journal entries
   - Test different verbosity settings for synthesized context
   - Compare journal quality before and after implementation

### Quality Assessment
1. Implement a scoring system to evaluate synthesized context quality:
   - Relevance to current development tasks
   - Uniqueness compared to other context sources
   - Insight value beyond raw data
   - Accuracy of meta-context understanding

2. Conduct user testing:
   - Have developers review journal entries with synthesized context
   - Collect feedback on usefulness and accuracy
   - Measure impact on development workflow and documentation quality

### Performance Testing
1. Benchmark latency impact:
   - Measure additional time required for AI synthesis
   - Test with various project sizes and complexity levels
   - Optimize for minimal impact on journal generation time

2. Resource utilization testing:
   - Monitor memory usage during context collection
   - Verify CPU usage remains within acceptable limits
   - Test on different hardware configurations
