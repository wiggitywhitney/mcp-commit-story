# Task ID: 58
# Title: Implement Conversation Reconstruction from Cursor Databases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 57
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a function that intelligently reconstructs chronological conversations from separate user prompts and AI responses stored in Cursor databases, handling various edge cases and mismatches.
# Details:
This task involves creating a robust algorithm to reconstruct conversations from Cursor database collections:

1. Analyze the structure of Cursor databases to understand how user prompts and AI responses are stored:
   - User prompts lack timestamps
   - AI responses have unixMs timestamps
   - Collections may have mismatched counts or ordering issues

2. Design a reconstruction algorithm that:
   - Interleaves user prompts and AI responses chronologically
   - Handles cases where counts don't match (missing responses, multiple prompts)
   - Uses contextual clues to match prompts with responses when timestamps aren't available
   - Resolves ambiguities using AI-based context matching when necessary

3. Implement the `reconstruct_conversation()` function with the following signature:
```python
def reconstruct_conversation(cursor_db_path: str) -> List[ConversationTurn]:
    """
    Reconstructs a chronological conversation from Cursor database collections.
    
    Args:
        cursor_db_path: Path to the Cursor database
        
    Returns:
        List of ConversationTurn objects representing the reconstructed conversation
    """
```

4. Define a `ConversationTurn` class that includes:
   - Role (user/assistant)
   - Content
   - Timestamp (when available)
   - Confidence score for the matching (when applicable)

5. Implement heuristics for matching:
   - Sequential matching as a baseline
   - Content-based matching using semantic similarity
   - Time-proximity matching for responses with timestamps
   - Fallback strategies for ambiguous cases

6. Add detailed logging to track the reconstruction process and decisions made

7. Document known limitations and edge cases:
   - Handling of deleted messages
   - Conversations with multiple back-and-forth exchanges in rapid succession
   - Very long conversations with potential context confusion
   - Partial or corrupted database entries

8. Ensure the output format is compatible with section generators by providing appropriate conversion methods.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create mock Cursor database collections with known conversation patterns
   - Test reconstruction with perfect 1:1 prompt-response pairs
   - Test with missing responses (n prompts, n-m responses)
   - Test with extra responses (n prompts, n+m responses)
   - Test with out-of-order timestamps
   - Verify correct handling of edge cases

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test with real Cursor databases of varying sizes and complexities
   - Compare reconstructed conversations with known ground truth
   - Measure accuracy of reconstruction (correctly matched pairs / total pairs)
   - Verify timestamp ordering is preserved when available

3. Validation Testing:
   - Have human reviewers evaluate a sample of reconstructed conversations
   - Calculate inter-rater reliability for human judgments
   - Compare algorithm confidence scores with human judgments

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure reconstruction time for databases of different sizes
   - Ensure memory usage remains reasonable for large conversations

5. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with corrupted databases
   - Test with extremely long conversations
   - Test with conversations containing similar/repeated prompts
   - Test with conversations having long gaps between exchanges

6. Documentation Verification:
   - Ensure all known limitations are documented
   - Verify that output format meets the requirements of section generators
