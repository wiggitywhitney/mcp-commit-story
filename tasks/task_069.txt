# Task ID: 69
# Title: Clean Up Obsolete MCP and Signal Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove architectural bloat by eliminating signal-based code, redundant MCP tools, and unused infrastructure while preserving essential components for the remaining valuable MCP tools.

# Requirements:
[ ] Remove all signal-based architecture files and code completely
[ ] Remove 4 obsolete MCP tools from server.py: journal_new_entry, journal_init, journal_install_hook, journal_generate_daily_summary
[ ] Preserve 2 essential MCP tools: journal_add_reflection, journal_capture_context
[ ] Remove all signal-related test files
[ ] Update git hook worker to remove signal usage and use direct calls for all operations
[ ] Clean up signal-related imports and dependencies throughout codebase
[ ] Run static analysis to identify orphaned imports or unused code
[ ] Update documentation to remove signal architecture references
[ ] Ensure preserved MCP tools continue working correctly after cleanup

# Notes:
## Design Decisions Made:
1. **Signal Architecture**: Complete removal - signals were never working and are not used
2. **MCP Tools**: Remove 4 obsolete, preserve 2 essential ones
3. **Cleanup Strategy**: File-by-file TDD approach (remove one file → run tests → fix failures → next file)
4. **Testing**: Use comprehensive test suite to verify no regressions after each file removal

## Implementation Strategy:
- Remove files one at a time with immediate test feedback
- Remove signal infrastructure files first, then update core files
- Remove obsolete MCP tools after signal cleanup
- Preserve journal_add_reflection and journal_capture_context functionality
- Update git hook worker to use direct calls instead of signal creation

## Broken Test Guidelines:
When functionality is removed, handle broken tests as follows:
- **Remove tests** that specifically test deleted functionality (e.g., `test_create_tool_signal()`)
- **Fix tests** that test preserved functionality but happen to use removed components (e.g., `test_git_hook_worker()` that mocks removed functions)
- **Preserve test intent** when possible - update mocks and imports rather than deleting tests for working functionality
