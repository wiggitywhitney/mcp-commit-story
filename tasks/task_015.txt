# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite for all components of the MCP journal system.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive testing suite with the following components:

1. Unit tests
   - Test all individual functions and classes
   - Use pytest fixtures for test data
   - Mock external dependencies

2. Integration tests
   - Test end-to-end workflows
   - Test CLI commands
   - Test file creation and management

3. Test fixtures
   - Sample git repositories
   - Mock terminal histories
   - Sample chat histories
   - Various configuration files

4. Test utilities
   - Helper functions for test setup and teardown
   - Mock classes for external dependencies

5. Coverage reporting
   - Configure pytest-cov for coverage reporting
   - Aim for >90% test coverage

Example test implementation:
```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from mcp_journal.config import load_config, merge_configs
from mcp_journal.git_utils import find_repo, get_current_commit
from mcp_journal.journal import generate_journal_entry

@pytest.fixture
def mock_git_repo():
    """Create a mock git repository for testing."""
    repo_mock = MagicMock()
    commit_mock = MagicMock()
    commit_mock.hexsha = "abcdef1234567890"
    commit_mock.message = "Test commit message"
    commit_mock.author.name = "Test Author"
    commit_mock.author.email = "test@example.com"
    commit_mock.committed_datetime = datetime.now()
    
    repo_mock.head.commit = commit_mock
    return repo_mock

@pytest.fixture
def sample_config():
    """Create a sample configuration for testing."""
    return {
        "journal": {
            "path": "journal/",
            "auto_generate": True,
            "include_terminal": True,
            "include_chat": True,
            "include_mood": True,
            "section_order": [
                "summary",
                "accomplishments",
                "frustrations",
                "tone",
                "commit_details",
                "reflections"
            ]
        }
    }

def test_load_config(tmp_path, sample_config):
    """Test loading configuration from file."""
    config_path = tmp_path / ".mcp-journalrc.yaml"
    with open(config_path, "w") as f:
        yaml.dump(sample_config, f)
    
    with patch("pathlib.Path.cwd", return_value=tmp_path):
        config = load_config()
    
    assert config["journal"]["path"] == "journal/"
    assert config["journal"]["auto_generate"] is True

def test_generate_journal_entry(mock_git_repo, sample_config):
    """Test journal entry generation."""
    commit = get_current_commit(mock_git_repo)
    
    with patch("mcp_journal.journal.collect_terminal_history", return_value=None):
        with patch("mcp_journal.journal.collect_chat_history", return_value=None):
            entry = generate_journal_entry(
                commit=commit,
                config=sample_config,
                debug=True
            )
    
    assert "Test commit message" in entry
    assert commit["short_hash"] in entry
    assert "## Summary" in entry
```

# Test Strategy:
Ensure all tests are properly organized and documented. Use pytest's built-in features for test discovery and execution. Configure CI/CD to run tests automatically. Maintain high test coverage (>90%) across all modules.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Unit Testing Framework and Base Fixtures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the pytest framework with initial test fixtures for unit testing core components of the MCP journal system.
### Details:
Create a tests/ directory with proper structure (tests/unit/, tests/integration/, etc.). Implement base fixtures including mock_git_repo, sample_config, and temp_directory. Write initial test configuration in conftest.py with pytest markers. Set up pytest.ini with configuration for test discovery and reporting. Following TDD, write failing tests for core utility functions before implementing any actual test code.

## 2. Implement Unit Tests for Core Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for all core modules including config, git_utils, and journal generation functions.
### Details:
Following TDD principles, write failing tests first for each function in core modules. Implement tests for config loading/merging, git repository interaction, and journal entry generation. Mock all external dependencies including filesystem, git repositories, and user input. Organize tests by module with clear naming conventions. Include edge cases and error conditions. Implement test parameterization for functions that need to be tested with multiple inputs.

## 3. Implement Integration Tests and Workflow Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Create integration tests that verify end-to-end workflows and CLI command functionality.
### Details:
Following TDD, write failing integration tests for complete workflows. Test CLI commands using pytest-click or similar tools. Create tests for journal generation from git commits, terminal history collection, and chat history integration. Test file creation and management workflows. Implement tests for configuration loading from various locations. Create integration tests that verify multiple components work together correctly.

## 4. Implement Advanced Test Fixtures and Mocks [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create comprehensive test fixtures for complex test scenarios and mock external dependencies.
### Details:
Expand the basic fixtures with more sophisticated test data. Create fixtures for sample git repositories with commit history. Implement mock terminal histories with various commands and outputs. Create sample chat histories in different formats. Generate various configuration files for testing different settings. Implement mock classes for all external dependencies including git, filesystem, and user interfaces. Create helper functions for test setup and teardown.

## 5. Implement Test Coverage Reporting and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Configure coverage reporting tools and create comprehensive test documentation.
### Details:
Configure pytest-cov for coverage reporting. Set up coverage thresholds (aim for >90% overall). Create HTML and XML coverage reports. Implement CI integration for automated test running and coverage reporting. Document the testing approach, fixtures, and patterns in a TESTING.md file. Add test-related information to the project README. Create examples of how to run specific test suites. Document how to add new tests when implementing new features.

## 6. Review and update README/docs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and update the README.md and other documentation to reflect changes made in this task. Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and up to date.
