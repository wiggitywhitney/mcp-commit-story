# Task ID: 21
# Title: Integrate Codecov for Test Coverage Reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Codecov integration with the GitHub repository to track and report test coverage metrics, culminating in a functional coverage badge in the README.
# Details:
This task involves establishing a connection between the repository and Codecov to enable automated test coverage reporting. Implementation steps include:

1. Create a Codecov account if not already available and link it to the organization's GitHub account
2. Add the repository to Codecov's dashboard
3. Generate a Codecov token for secure communication between CI and Codecov
4. Update the CI pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.) to:
   - Install necessary coverage tools (e.g., pytest-cov for Python)
   - Run tests with coverage collection enabled
   - Upload coverage reports to Codecov using the token
5. Add a `.codecov.yml` configuration file to the repository root to customize coverage settings (thresholds, exclusions, etc.)
6. Uncomment or add the Codecov badge in the README.md file using the format provided by Codecov
7. Verify the badge displays the actual coverage percentage after the first successful upload

Consider setting coverage thresholds to maintain code quality and potentially configure PR comments from Codecov to highlight coverage changes in code reviews.

# Test Strategy:
To verify successful completion of this task:

1. Manually trigger a CI build and confirm the coverage report is generated and uploaded to Codecov
2. Check the Codecov dashboard to ensure:
   - The repository appears with correct coverage data
   - Historical data begins tracking from the first upload
   - Coverage reports include all relevant files (no critical omissions)
3. Verify the Codecov badge in the README:
   - Badge is properly displayed (not broken)
   - Badge shows an actual percentage value (not "unknown" or "N/A")
   - The percentage matches what's shown in the Codecov dashboard
4. Create a test PR with code changes that would affect coverage (both positively and negatively) to confirm:
   - Codecov reports the coverage change in the PR
   - The badge updates accordingly after merging
5. Document the integration process in the project documentation for future reference
6. Have another team member verify they can access the Codecov dashboard for the repository
