# Task ID: 56
# Title: Remove Terminal Command Collection Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove all terminal command collection code and references from the codebase since this functionality is no longer feasible in the current architecture and provides limited value.
# Details:
This task involves systematically removing all terminal command collection infrastructure from the codebase:

1. First, identify all references to terminal-related code:
   - Use grep to search for "collect_ai_terminal_commands", "TerminalContext", "TerminalCommand", "TerminalCommandsSection", "generate_terminal_commands", and "journal_context.terminal"
   - Document all locations for systematic removal

2. Remove from Type System in src/mcp_commit_story/context_types.py:
   - Remove TerminalCommand TypedDict
   - Remove TerminalContext TypedDict
   - Remove TerminalCommandsSection TypedDict
   - Update JournalContext to remove terminal: Optional[TerminalContext] field

3. Remove Collection Function from src/mcp_commit_story/context_collection.py:
   - Remove entire collect_ai_terminal_commands() function
   - Remove related imports

4. Remove from Journal Generation in src/mcp_commit_story/journal.py:
   - Remove generate_terminal_commands_section() function
   - Remove related imports
   - Remove any calls to terminal generation

5. Update Integration Points:
   - Fix any code that constructs JournalContext to not include terminal field
   - Update any journal workflow code that expects terminal context
   - Ensure clean removal with no dangling references

6. Update Tests:
   - Remove tests specifically for terminal functionality
   - Update any integration tests that construct JournalContext
   - Fix any test fixtures that include terminal data

7. Documentation Cleanup:
   - Update docs/context-collection.md
   - Remove terminal command references from all documentation
   - Add removal note to architecture docs

8. Add architecture decision note to context_collection.py:
```python
# Architecture Decision: Terminal Command Collection Removed (2025-06-27)
# Terminal commands were originally designed to be collected by Cursor's AI with
# access to its execution context. With the shift to external journal generation,
# we no longer have access. Git diffs and chat context provide sufficient narrative.
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Before making changes:
   - Run full test suite to establish baseline: `python -m pytest tests/ -x --tb=short`
   - Note any tests that currently reference terminal functionality
   - Document current test count for comparison after removal

2. After making changes:
   - Run full test suite again: `python -m pytest tests/ -x --tb=short`
   - Verify same number of tests pass (minus any terminal-specific tests removed)
   - Re-run grep commands from identification step - all should return empty:
     ```
     grep -r "collect_ai_terminal_commands" src/ tests/
     grep -r "TerminalContext" src/ tests/
     grep -r "TerminalCommand" src/ tests/
     grep -r "TerminalCommandsSection" src/ tests/
     grep -r "generate_terminal_commands" src/ tests/
     grep -r "journal_context.terminal" src/ tests/
     ```
   - Manually verify that journal generation still works by running the journal generation process
   - Check that no references to terminal commands appear in generated journals
   - Verify documentation is updated and consistent with the removal of terminal command functionality

3. Final verification checklist:
   - All terminal-related types removed
   - All terminal-related functions removed
   - All references in other code updated
   - Tests updated and passing
   - Documentation updated
   - Architecture decision documented
