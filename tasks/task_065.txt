# Task ID: 65
# Title: Update Journal Section Prompts for Concrete Language and Improved Content Quality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Revise all journal section prompts to replace abstract corporate language with concrete, specific language that captures real development stories, emotional journeys, and decision points.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the External Reader Accessibility Guidelines across all journal section prompts to improve content quality:

1. Identify all existing journal section prompts in the codebase:
   - Daily summary prompts
   - Weekly reflection prompts
   - Milestone documentation prompts
   - Any other journal content generation prompts

2. For each prompt:
   - Remove abstract corporate language and replace with guidance for concrete, specific descriptions
   - Add explicit instructions to capture important statements with emphasis ('!')
   - Remove artificial mood categorizations and encourage authentic emotional expression
   - Add specific prompting for decision points and trade-offs made during development
   - Include guidance to connect technical progress with the emotional journey

3. Example prompt transformation:
   From: "Describe the revolutionary implementation of architectural components"
   To: "Describe specifically what you built today, including:
       - Exact problems you encountered and how you solved them
       - Key decisions you made and why (what alternatives did you consider?)
       - How you felt during challenging moments and what you learned
       - Concrete examples of code or functionality you implemented"

4. Update the prompt templates in the codebase:
   - Modify prompt template files
   - Update any hardcoded prompts in the AI function implementations
   - Ensure all journal-related functions use the updated prompts

5. Document the changes in a README or documentation file explaining the new guidelines for journal content.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Review:
   - Review all updated prompt templates against the External Reader Accessibility Guidelines
   - Verify each prompt explicitly requests concrete language, emotional journey, and decision points
   - Check that artificial mood categorizations have been removed

2. Test Journal Generation:
   - Generate sample journal entries using the updated prompts
   - Verify the generated content includes specific technical details rather than abstract language
   - Confirm the content captures decision points, trade-offs, and emotional aspects
   - Have team members review sample outputs to ensure they provide value to external readers

3. User Testing:
   - Have 2-3 team members use the updated journal prompts for their actual work
   - Collect feedback on whether the prompts are clear and produce better quality content
   - Compare before/after examples of journal content to verify improvement

4. AI Analysis:
   - Run a test where an AI analyzes old vs. new journal content
   - Verify the AI can extract more concrete information and insights from the new content
   - Confirm the new content provides more value for future reference
