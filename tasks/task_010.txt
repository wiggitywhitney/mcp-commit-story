# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Manual Reflection Addition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the functionality to add manual reflections to journal entries through the MCP server and AI agent, ensuring they are prioritized in summaries. Begin with a research phase to determine the optimal implementation approach.
# Details:
Implement manual reflection addition in the MCP server following TDD methodology and on-demand directory creation patterns. The implementation should prioritize MCP-first architecture principles.

Key implementation requirements:

1. Research and decide on the optimal approach (MCP prompt vs. tool) for manual reflection addition
2. Implement core reflection functionality with proper timestamp formatting and file appending
3. Create MCP handler for reflection operations with appropriate error handling
4. Follow on-demand directory creation pattern (create directories only when needed)
5. Ensure all file operations use the ensure_journal_directory utility before writing
6. Maintain MCP-first architecture with no CLI commands for operational functions

Refer to individual subtasks for detailed implementation plans.

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive testing following TDD methodology:

1. Unit tests for core reflection functionality (formatting, file operations)
2. Integration tests for MCP handler implementation
3. Tests for on-demand directory creation compliance
4. Tests for proper file handling (new and existing journal files)
5. End-to-end tests for AI agent integration
6. Verification tests for CLI limitations (no operational commands)

All tests should verify compliance with the on-demand directory creation pattern and MCP-first architecture principles as documented in project guidelines.

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

Successfully implemented all core reflection functionality following TDD methodology:

**1. Tests Written First ✅**
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_reflection_core.py` (13 tests)
- All tests initially failed (as expected in TDD)
- Full coverage of directory creation, reflection formatting, file operations, unicode handling, and error scenarios

**2. Design Choices Approved ✅**
- Reflection format: `## Reflection (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)` with double newlines
- Timestamp format: ISO 8601 compatible `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` 
- File operations: UTF-8 encoding with `\n\n` section separators (following existing codebase patterns)
- Leveraging existing `ensure_journal_directory` utility from journal.py

**3. Implementation Complete ✅**
- Created `src/mcp_commit_story/reflection_core.py` with two core functions:
  - `format_reflection()`: Handles timestamp and H2 header formatting
  - `add_reflection_to_journal()`: File operations with proper directory creation and UTF-8 encoding
- Used existing `ensure_journal_directory` from journal.py for on-demand directory creation
- Proper error handling with meaningful exceptions

**4. Tests Pass ✅**
- 13/13 reflection core tests passing
- Fixed critical test isolation issue affecting entire test suite
- 495 total tests passing, 25 xfailed (expected AI-dependent failures)

**5. Documentation Complete ✅**
- Comprehensive module docstring explaining purpose and patterns
- Detailed function docstrings with args, returns, raises, and format examples
- Integration with existing codebase patterns documented
- PRD updated with manual reflection capability

**6. Full Test Suite ✅**
- All 495 tests passing with no blocking failures
- Test isolation issue resolved

**READY FOR NEXT SUBTASK**: Core utilities complete and tested, ready for MCP Handler Implementation (10.3)
