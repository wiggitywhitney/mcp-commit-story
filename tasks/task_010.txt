# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Blog Post Conversion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the journal/blogify operation to convert journal entries to blog post format.
# Details:
Implement the journal/blogify operation with the following functionality:

1. File processing
   - Accept single or multiple file paths
   - Read and parse journal entries

2. Content transformation
   - Convert to natural, readable blog post
   - Remove headers, timestamps, code references
   - Add transitions, rewrite for narrative flow

3. Output generation
   - Generate blog post in Markdown format
   - Save to new file or return as string

Example implementation:
```python
def handle_blogify(params):
    """Handle journal/blogify operation."""
    debug = params.get("debug", False)
    try:
        # Get file paths
        file_paths = params.get("files", [])
        if not file_paths:
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "message": "No files specified for blogify operation."
            }
        
        # Read and parse journal entries
        entries = []
        for file_path in file_paths:
            path = Path(file_path)
            if not path.exists():
                return {
                    "status": "error",
                    "message": f"File not found: {file_path}"
                }
            
            with open(path, "r") as f:
                content = f.read()
            
            entries.append({"path": file_path, "content": content})
        
        # Transform content to blog post
        blog_post = transform_to_blog_post(entries)
        
        # Save to new file or return as string
        if params.get("output"):
            output_path = Path(params["output"])
            with open(output_path, "w") as f:
                f.write(blog_post)
            
            return {
                "status": "success",
                "message": f"Blog post generated and saved to {output_path}.",
                "path": str(output_path)
            }
        else:
            return {
                "status": "success",
                "message": "Blog post generated.",
                "content": blog_post
            }
    except Exception as e:
        if debug:
            return {"status": "error", "message": f"Blogify operation failed: {str(e)}"}
        return {"status": "error", "message": "Blogify operation failed. Use --debug for details."}
```

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for:
- File processing
- Content transformation
- Output generation

Test with various journal entry formats and content types.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement File Processing Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module to handle file processing for the blogify operation, including accepting single or multiple file paths, validating their existence, and reading their contents.
### Details:
Create a `file_processor.py` module with functions to validate file paths and read journal entries. Implement a main function `process_files(file_paths)` that takes a list of file paths, validates each path exists, reads the content, and returns a list of dictionaries with 'path' and 'content' keys.

## 2. Implement Content Transformation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the core transformation logic to convert journal entries into natural, readable blog post format by removing technical elements and improving narrative flow.
### Details:
Create a `content_transformer.py` module with a main function `transform_to_blog_post(entries)` that takes the output from the file processor and converts it to blog format. Implement helper functions to: remove headers and timestamps, strip code references, add natural transitions between paragraphs, and rewrite content for better narrative flow. Consider using NLP techniques or rule-based transformations.

## 3. Implement Output Generation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a module to handle the output generation of the transformed blog post, either saving to a file or returning as a string.
### Details:
Create an `output_generator.py` module with a main function `generate_output(blog_post, output_path=None)` that takes the transformed blog post content and an optional output path. If an output path is provided, save the content to that file and return a success message with the path. If no output path is provided, return the content as a string.

## 4. Implement Main Blogify Handler Function [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement the main handler function that orchestrates the entire blogify operation by calling the file processing, content transformation, and output generation modules.
### Details:
Create the `handle_blogify(params)` function in the main module that: 1) Extracts parameters like file paths, debug mode, and output path, 2) Calls the file processor to read entries, 3) Passes entries to the content transformer, 4) Uses the output generator to produce the final result, 5) Handles exceptions and returns appropriate response objects with status and messages.

## 5. Integrate and Test End-to-End Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Integrate all components and perform end-to-end testing of the blogify operation with various input scenarios and edge cases.
### Details:
Create integration tests that test the complete blogify workflow with various inputs: 1) Single file conversion, 2) Multiple file conversion, 3) Different journal formats, 4) Edge cases like empty files or malformed content. Update the main module to expose the blogify functionality through the appropriate API or command-line interface. Document usage examples and expected outputs.

## 6. Review and update README/docs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and update the README.md and other documentation to reflect changes made in this task. Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and up to date.
