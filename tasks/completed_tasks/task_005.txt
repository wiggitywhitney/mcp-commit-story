# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Journal Entry Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core functionality for generating journal entries from Git commits, terminal history, and chat context.
# Details:
Implement journal entry generation in `src/mcp_journal/journal.py` with the following features:

1. Journal entry structure:
```python
class JournalEntry:
    """Represents a journal entry with all sections"""
    def __init__(self, commit, config):
        self.commit = commit
        self.config = config
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        self.sections = {}
        # Initialize sections based on config
    
    def to_markdown(self):
        """Convert entry to markdown format"""
        # Implementation
```

2. Section generators:
```python
def generate_summary_section(commit, context):
    """Generate the summary section"""
    # Implementation

def generate_accomplishments_section(commit, context):
    """Generate the accomplishments section"""
    # Implementation

def generate_frustrations_section(commit, context):
    """Generate the frustrations section"""

    """Generate the tone/mood section"""
    # Implementation

def generate_commit_details_section(commit):
    """Generate the commit details section"""
    # Implementation
```

3. Context collection:
```python
def collect_terminal_history(since_timestamp=None):
    """Collect terminal history since timestamp"""
    # Implementation

def collect_chat_history(since_commit=None):
    """Collect chat history since commit reference"""
    # Implementation

def collect_ai_terminal_commands():
    """Collect terminal commands executed by AI"""
    # Implementation
```

4. File operations:
```python
def get_journal_file_path(date=None):
    """Get path to journal file for date"""
    # Implementation

def append_to_journal_file(entry, file_path):
    """Append entry to journal file"""
    # Implementation

def create_journal_directories():
    """Create journal directory structure"""
    # Implementation
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each section generator
2. Tests for context collection methods
3. Tests for file operations
4. Tests for markdown formatting
5. Tests for handling missing context gracefully
6. Integration tests for full entry generation
7. Tests for anti-hallucination rules

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement JournalEntry class with tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the JournalEntry class structure and tests for initialization and markdown conversion, with explicit user collaboration at each step
### Details:
Create tests in `tests/test_journal_entry.py` that verify: 1) JournalEntry initializes with commit and config, 2) sections are created based on config, 3) to_markdown() produces correct format. Then implement the JournalEntry class in `src/mcp_journal/journal.py`.

Collaboration steps:
1. Present proposed JournalEntry class structure to user for review
2. Ask specific questions about user preferences:
   - What should the default order of sections be?
   - What timestamp format do you prefer (24h or 12h)?
   - How should section headers be formatted in markdown?
   - What metadata should be included in each entry?
3. Create test cases based on user feedback and present for approval
4. Document all user decisions in code comments and docstrings
5. Implement the class based on approved design
6. Present implementation for final review before marking complete
<info added on 2025-05-20T20:03:40.330Z>
Planned the JournalEntry class implementation based on explicit user preferences and project requirements.

**User Decisions:**
- Sections: Only the following will be included in standard journal entries: Summary, Accomplishments, Frustrations or Roadblocks, Terminal Commands (AI Session), Discussion Notes (from chat), Tone + Mood (inferred), Behind the Commit. The 'Reflections' section is omitted from standard entries and handled separately.
- Field Names: Use the names from the current documentation/spec. Omit empty sections in output; no need to designate required/optional fields.
- Extensibility: No formal extension mechanism now; keep code modular and easy to extend via TDD in the future.
- Output Format: Markdown only, following the established format (headers, lists, code blocks, blockquotes as in examples).
- Review: User will review and approve the proposed class structure and test plan before any code is written.

**Next Steps:**
1. Present a proposed Python class structure and TDD test plan for user review and approval before implementation.
</info added on 2025-05-20T20:03:40.330Z>
<info added on 2025-05-20T21:16:38.374Z>
Finalized the implementation plan for the JournalEntry class and its tests, incorporating user feedback and formatting consistency improvements.

**Key Decisions and Updates:**
- Terminal commands are rendered in a bash code block with a descriptive line, not as a bulleted list.
- Discussion notes support speaker attribution (Human/Agent) and multiline text, rendered as blockquotes with speaker labels.
- The entry header includes both timestamp and commit hash.
- The Tone/Mood section uses blockquotes for both mood and indicators, matching the narrative style of other sections.
- All sections omit empty content, and the class is modular for future extension.
- The test plan covers initialization, Markdown serialization, edge cases (multiline, long entries), and formatting for all sections, including new tests for blockquote formatting in Tone/Mood.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement the full test file (`tests/test_journal_entry.py`) covering all discussed cases and formatting rules.
2. Implement the JournalEntry class in `src/mcp_commit_story/journal.py` to pass all tests and match the agreed formatting.

## 2. Implement file operations with tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tests and implement file operation functions for journal management, with explicit user collaboration at each step
### Details:
Create tests in `tests/test_file_operations.py` for get_journal_file_path(), append_to_journal_file(), and create_journal_directories(). Then implement these functions in `src/mcp_journal/journal.py`. Use mocking for file system operations.

Collaboration steps:
1. Present proposed file structure and naming conventions to user
2. Ask specific questions about user preferences:
   - What directory structure do you prefer for journal files?
   - How should files be named (date format, prefixes, etc.)?
   - Should entries be appended to existing files or create new files?
   - What file permissions should be set?
3. Create test cases based on user feedback and present for approval
4. Document all user decisions in code comments and docstrings
5. Implement functions based on approved design
6. Present implementation for final review before marking complete

## 3. Implement context collection functions with tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tests and implement functions to collect terminal history, chat history, and AI commands, with explicit user collaboration at each step
### Details:
Create tests in `tests/test_context_collection.py` for collect_terminal_history(), collect_chat_history(), and collect_ai_terminal_commands(). Then implement these functions in `src/mcp_journal/journal.py`. Use mocking for external dependencies.

Collaboration steps:
1. Present proposed context collection approach to user
2. Ask specific questions about user preferences:
   - How far back should terminal history be collected?
   - What format should chat history be stored in?
   - How should AI commands be distinguished from user commands?
   - What context should be excluded or filtered out?
3. Create test cases based on user feedback and present for approval
4. Document all user decisions in code comments and docstrings
5. Implement functions based on approved design
6. Present implementation for final review before marking complete
<info added on 2025-05-21T21:51:00.769Z>
Implementation Plan for Context Collection Functions:

1. Adaptive lookback approach:
   - Search backward through current conversation for last "mcp-commit-story new-entry" command
   - Use this command as boundary for context collection
   - Default to 18-hour window if boundary command not found

2. Filtering specifications:
   - Apply terminal command and discussion note filtering as specified
   - No additional exclusions needed
   - No logging of filtered commands required

3. Content handling:
   - Exclude ambiguous discussion notes
   - Rely on AI prompt instructions for sensitive data filtering
   - No persistent storage of chat/discussion history beyond journal entries

4. Implementation process:
   - Develop AI prompts with checklists for both chat and terminal command extraction
   - Present checklists to user for review and approval before implementation
   - Implement approved design in collect_terminal_history(), collect_chat_history(), and collect_ai_terminal_commands()

## 7. Implement edge case handling and error recovery [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Add robust error handling and edge case management to all journal functions, with explicit user collaboration at each step
### Details:
Update all functions to handle edge cases like missing data, API failures, or permission issues. Add appropriate error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms.

Collaboration steps:
1. Present proposed error handling approach to user
2. Ask specific questions about user preferences:
   - How should errors be communicated to the user?
   - What fallback behavior is preferred for missing data?
   - What level of logging detail is appropriate?
   - Which errors should be fatal vs. non-fatal?
3. Create test cases based on user feedback and present for approval
4. Document all user decisions in code comments and docstrings

# Implementation Plan for 5.7: Edge Case Handling and Error Recovery (TDD)

## Scope:
- Cover all context collection functions in src/mcp_commit_story/context_collection.py (collect_chat_history, collect_ai_terminal_commands, collect_git_context)
- Cover all journal entry and section generator functions in src/mcp_commit_story/journal.py (including file operations, section generators, and markdown serialization)

## Step 0: Log Implementation Plan (this step)
- Mark subtask as in progress and document this plan in Taskmaster
- Note section-specific and function-specific considerations

## Step 1: Identify Edge Cases and Error Types
- For each function, enumerate possible edge cases:
  - Missing or malformed input/context (e.g., None, empty dict, missing fields)
  - Invalid data types in TypedDicts (wrong types, partial data)
  - API or file system failures (file not found, permission denied, git errors)
  - Boundary conditions (empty lists, large data, unusual commit structures)
- Define custom error types if needed (e.g., ContextTypeError, ContextValueError)

## Step 2: Write Failing Tests (TDD)
- In tests/test_error_handling.py, write tests for:
  - Each context collection function: test handling of missing, partial, and invalid context
  - Each section generator: test handling of missing/invalid context, empty/None input, and type errors
  - File operations: test file not found, permission errors, and invalid paths
  - JournalEntry and JournalParser: test malformed markdown, missing sections, and invalid field types
  - Ensure all tests fail before implementation

## Step 3: Implement Error Handling and Logging
- Update each function to handle edge cases gracefully:
  - Validate TypedDict structure and types at runtime where feasible
  - Add try/except blocks for file and git operations
  - Log or raise clear, actionable errors for invalid input or failures
  - Provide fallback/default behavior where appropriate (e.g., return empty section, skip invalid data)
  - Ensure error messages are clear and actionable

## Step 4: Rerun Tests and Refine
- Rerun the test suite to confirm all error handling is covered and tests now pass
- Refine error handling and logging based on test results and user feedback

## Step 5: Document Error Handling Strategy
- Add code comments and docstrings explaining error handling logic and edge case coverage
- Update developer documentation as needed

## Section-Specific Considerations:
- Context collection functions must enforce the in-memory-only rule and never persist sensitive or invalid data
- Section generators must never raise on missing/empty context; always return a valid (possibly empty) section
- File operations must not overwrite or corrupt existing journal data on error
- All error handling must be anti-hallucination compliant: never invent or infer data not present in context

## TDD:
- All error handling must be test-driven: write failing tests first, then implement fixes
- Tests must cover both expected and unexpected edge cases for all functions in context_collection.py and journal.py

## 9. Journal Entry Format Improvements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve the formatting and readability of generated journal entries. This includes adding visual separators between entries, adjusting header hierarchy, improving speaker change clarity in discussion notes, and making additional whitespace and formatting improvements for code blocks, lists, and blockquotes. [Updated: 5/20/2025]
### Details:
- Add a horizontal rule (---) between each journal entry for clear separation.
- Adjust header levels: use H3 for the timestamp-commit header and H4 for section headers to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
- Insert a blank line when the speaker changes in discussion notes (e.g., from Human to Agent or vice versa).
- Add consistent spacing after section headers.
- Ensure terminal commands are formatted as code blocks with consistent styling.
- Add more space between bullet points in lists for readability.
- Make blockquotes visually distinct with clear indentation or styling.
- Review and update the journal entry generation logic and templates to implement these improvements.
<info added on 2025-05-20T23:02:02.813Z>
## Test-Driven Development Approach

Implement all journal entry formatting improvements using Test-Driven Development (TDD):

1. Write failing tests first for each formatting feature:
   - Test for horizontal rule (---) between entries
   - Test for proper header hierarchy (H3 for timestamp-commit, H4 for sections)
   - Test for line breaks when speakers change in discussion notes
   - Test for consistent spacing after section headers
   - Test for proper code block formatting of terminal commands
   - Test for appropriate spacing between bullet points in lists
   - Test for proper blockquote styling and indentation

2. Implement each feature only after writing its corresponding test
3. Refactor code while maintaining passing tests
4. Create integration tests that verify multiple formatting rules working together

### Acceptance Criteria
- All formatting improvements must be covered by automated tests
- Test suite must remain green throughout development
- Each test should clearly document the expected formatting behavior
- Edge cases should be identified and tested (e.g., nested lists, multiple consecutive speaker changes)

## 11. Document and Formalize Context Collection Data Structures [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Define and document the data structures used for context collection functions (`collect_chat_history`, `collect_ai_terminal_commands`, etc.), and explicitly codify the in-memory-only rule. This includes:
- Adding explicit type hints, `TypedDict`, or `dataclass` definitions for the returned data.
- Documenting the expected structure in code and in the project documentation (README or `docs/`).
- Ensuring all context remains ephemeral and is only persisted as part of the generated journal entry.
- Updating the Taskmaster plan and code comments to reference these definitions.
### Details:
- Add explicit type hints, `TypedDict`, or `dataclass` definitions for the returned data in context collection functions.
- Document the expected structure in code and in the project documentation (README or `docs/`).
- Ensure all context remains ephemeral and is only persisted as part of the generated journal entry.
- Update the Taskmaster plan and code comments to reference these definitions.
<info added on 2025-05-23T09:28:48.079Z>
## Subtask Objective
Formalize and document the data structures used for context collection in the journal entry generation system. This includes:
- Adding TypedDict or dataclass definitions for all context collection return values (e.g., chat history, terminal context, commit info, etc.)
- Documenting the expected structure in code and in developer docs
- Ensuring the 'in-memory-only' rule is codified in comments and type hints
- Updating code comments to reference these definitions

## Collaboration Steps
- Review the engineering spec and any related documentation for required data structure fields
- Identify all functions in journal.py and related modules that return or manipulate context data
- Propose initial TypedDict or dataclass definitions and review for completeness
- Discuss/confirm with collaborators (if needed) before finalizing

## Test Strategy
- Add or update tests to check that all context collection functions return data matching the new type definitions
- Ensure tests fail before implementation (test-driven)
- Update existing tasks to require these data structures in their tests moving forward

## Implementation Plan
1. Search for all context collection functions (e.g., collect_chat_history, collect_terminal_context, etc.)
2. Draft TypedDict or dataclass definitions for their return values
3. Add/Update docstrings and comments to reference these types
4. Update developer documentation to include these structures
5. Add/Update tests to enforce the new types
6. Update related tasks to reference the new data structures in their requirements

## Notes
- This work is foundational for all section generator tasks (5.13-5.19)
- Adheres to the engineering spec's emphasis on explicit type hints and documentation
- Will improve maintainability and reduce errors in downstream implementation

## Dependencies
This subtask depends on subtask 5.21 (Implement collect_git_context and Integrate Real Git Data Collection).

## Implementation Order Clarification
This subtask will formalize all context collection data structures, including the git context structure returned by collect_git_context. The correct implementation order is:
1. First implement git context collection (subtask 5.21)
2. Then formalize all context collection data structures together in this subtask

This ensures that all context collection mechanisms are in place before we define and standardize their data structures, preventing rework and ensuring comprehensive type definitions across all context sources.

# Integration Test Implementation Plan

## Goal
Validate that all section generator functions work together to produce a complete, correctly formatted journal entry and ensure robust integration between context collection, section generation, and markdown serialization/parsing.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Integration Test Design (TDD)
- Create `tests/unit/test_journal_integration.py` with failing integration tests that:
  - Use a realistic, fully populated JournalContext TypedDict
  - Call each section generator and assemble results into a JournalEntry
  - Serialize the JournalEntry to markdown and parse it back
  - Assert round-trip integrity: parsed entry matches original data
  - Test with partial/missing context, empty sections, and edge cases

### Step 2: Implement Integration Logic and Fixes
- Update section generators to properly accept and use the JournalContext parameter
- Ensure section generators correctly extract required data from the TypedDict
- Verify no section generator modifies the TypedDict in ways that break others
- Implement proper handling of missing/empty sections in the output

### Step 3: Rerun Tests and Refine
- Confirm all integration tests pass
- Verify the complete journal generation pipeline maintains context integrity
- Refine code based on test results and feedback

### Step 4: Document Integration Strategy
- Add code comments explaining integration logic and test coverage
- Document how the JournalContext flows through the system

## Integration-Specific Considerations
- Enforce anti-hallucination and formatting rules across all sections
- Handle missing/empty sections gracefully in both generation and parsing
- Ensure round-trip serialization/parsing is lossless for all supported fields
- Test with both minimal and maximal context for robustness

All integration logic and fixes will follow TDD principles, with failing tests written before implementation.

## 21. Implement collect_git_context and Integrate Real Git Data Collection (TDD) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace the three mock functions (get_commit_metadata, get_code_diff, get_changed_files) in journal.py with a single collect_git_context() function that imports and uses the real git functions from git_utils.py.

- **Function Design:**
  - Implement collect_git_context(commit_hash=None) in git_utils.py. This function returns a structured dictionary containing all git data needed for journal entries.
  - Use get_current_commit, get_commit_details, and get_commit_diff_summary from git_utils.py as the foundation.
  - The returned dictionary should include: metadata (from get_commit_details), diff_summary (from get_commit_diff_summary), file_stats (count of different file types), and commit_context (merge status, commit size classification).
- **Enhanced File Analysis:**
  - Add helper functions to classify files by type (source code, config, docs, tests) and determine commit size (small/medium/large based on total lines changed). Keep analysis simple and journal-appropriate.
- **Integration Points:**
  - Update any code in journal.py that calls the mock functions to use collect_git_context instead, following the context collection pattern of collect_chat_history and collect_ai_terminal_commands.
- **TypedDict Definition:**
  - As part of Task 5.11, define a TypedDict for the git context structure to provide proper type hints and documentation for downstream section generators.
- **Implementation Priority:**
  - Start with basic functionality using existing git_utils functions, then add file classification and commit size analysis as enhancements. Do not implement full diff parsing or line-by-line analysis.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update the engineering spec section on "Data Sources" to include git context collection. Add git context to context collection code examples in Task 5. Update function docstrings in journal.py to reference the new git context structure. Document the git context TypedDict in code comments and developer docs.
- **TDD Approach:**
  - Write failing tests for collect_git_context before implementation, covering structure, data accuracy, file classification, and commit size.
- **Task Dependencies:**
  - After this subtask is created, update Task 5.11 to depend on this subtask, since it will formalize the data structures created here.

**Note:** collect_git_context() should live in git_utils.py, as it is a core git data collection utility.
