If no configuration exists:\n     - Copy the example file to .mcp-journalrc.yaml, or\n     - Generate default configuration programmatically\n   - Include this in the application startup flow\n\n5. **Auto-Generation Settings**\n   - Implement commit-based entry generation as core functionality\n   - Do not make this optional in the configuration\n\n6. **Documentation Updates**\n   - Update README.md to explain the configuration approach\n   - Document that auto-generation on commits is a core feature\n\n7. **Testing**\n   - Test the initialization logic\n   - Verify the example file is properly formatted\n   - Ensure the application correctly loads configuration\n</info added on 2025-05-18T20:53:45.394Z>",

Current State of src/mcp_journal/git_utils.py\n- Functions implemented: is_git_repo, get_repo, get_current_commit, is_journal_only_commit, get_commit_details\n- Code style: Uses docstrings, type hints, error handling, and conditional import of GitPython. Follows project conventions.\n- Missing functions (per spec/task): get_commit_diff_summary, install_post_commit_hook, backup_existing_hook, get_commits_since_last_entry\n\n2. Dependencies\n- GitPython is conditionally imported and used. Should be present in pyproject.toml (verify and add if missing).\n\n3. Test Coverage\n- Test file: tests/unit/test_git_utils.py exists and is substantial (140 lines).\n- Coverage: Tests for existing functions likely present, but not for missing functions. No test fixtures for git repo manipulation in tests/fixtures/.\n- Recommendation: Create pytest fixtures for temporary git repositories to support robust TDD for new and existing functions.\n\n4. Summary of Gaps and Immediate Needs\n- Gaps: Several required functions are not yet implemented or stubbed. No test fixtures for git repo setup/teardown. Need to verify GitPython is in pyproject.toml.\n- Immediate needs before further TDD: Add/verify GitPython in dependencies. Create pytest fixture for temporary git repos.

This function returns a structured dictionary containing all git data needed for journal entries.\n  - Use get_current_commit, get_commit_details, and get_commit_diff_summary from git_utils.py as the foundation.\n  - The returned dictionary should include: metadata (from get_commit_details), diff_summary (from get_commit_diff_summary), file_stats (count of different file types), and commit_context (merge status, commit size classification).\n- **Enhanced File Analysis:**\n  - Add helper functions to classify files by type (source code, config, docs, tests) and determine commit size (small/medium/large based on total lines changed). Keep analysis simple and journal-appropriate.\n- **Integration Points:**\n  - Update any code in journal.py that calls the mock functions to use collect_git_context instead, following the context collection pattern of collect_chat_history and collect_ai_terminal_commands.\n- **TypedDict Definition:**\n  - As part of Task 5.11, define a TypedDict for the git context structure to provide proper type hints and documentation for downstream section generators.\n- **Implementation Priority:**\n  - Start with basic functionality using existing git_utils functions, then add file classification and commit size analysis as enhancements. Do not implement full diff parsing or line-by-line analysis.\n- **Documentation Updates:**\n  - Update the engineering spec section on \"Data Sources\" to include git context collection. Add git context to context collection code examples in Task 5. Update function docstrings in journal.py to reference the new git context structure. Document the git context TypedDict in code comments and developer docs.\n- **TDD Approach:**\n  - Write failing tests for collect_git_context before implementation, covering structure, data accuracy, file classification, and commit size.\n- **Task Dependencies:**\n  - After this subtask is created, update Task 5.11 to depend on this subtask, since it will formalize the data structures created here.\n\n**Note:** collect_git_context() should live in git_utils.py, as it is a core git data collection utility.",

Write minimal, failing unit/integration tests:\n   - Test MCP server integration with minimal journal entry operations\n   - Test CLI tool processing of minimal journal entries\n   - Test error handling for common failure scenarios (server down, invalid input)\n2. Verify tests fail appropriately before implementation\n3. Implement minimal integration function/script for MCP server and CLI tool interaction\n4. Refactor implementation until tests pass while maintaining minimal codebase\n5. Document any implementation shortcuts and assumptions\n6.
