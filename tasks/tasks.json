Current State of src/mcp_journal/git_utils.py\n- Functions implemented: is_git_repo, get_repo, get_current_commit, is_journal_only_commit, get_commit_details\n- Code style: Uses docstrings, type hints, error handling, and conditional import of GitPython. Follows project conventions.\n- Missing functions (per spec/task): get_commit_diff_summary, install_post_commit_hook, backup_existing_hook, get_commits_since_last_entry\n\n2. Dependencies\n- GitPython is conditionally imported and used. Should be present in pyproject.toml (verify and add if missing).\n\n3. Test Coverage\n- Test file: tests/unit/test_git_utils.py exists and is substantial (140 lines).\n- Coverage: Tests for existing functions likely present, but not for missing functions. No test fixtures for git repo manipulation in tests/fixtures/.\n- Recommendation: Create pytest fixtures for temporary git repositories to support robust TDD for new and existing functions.\n\n4. Summary of Gaps and Immediate Needs\n- Gaps: Several required functions are not yet implemented or stubbed. No test fixtures for git repo setup/teardown. Need to verify GitPython is in pyproject.toml.\n- Immediate needs before further TDD: Add/verify GitPython in dependencies. Create pytest fixture for temporary git repos.

Create minimal unit tests first:\n   - Test that documentation function accepts test results and generates markdown summary\n   - Test that generated documentation includes sections for successes, failures, and recommendations\n   - Test that recommendations are actionable and directly tied to test metrics\n   - Test graceful handling of edge cases (empty results, incomplete data)\n\n2. Implement a minimal documentation generator function that:\n   - Takes structured test results as input\n   - Produces markdown-formatted output with key findings\n   - Includes actionable recommendations based on metrics\n   - Handles edge cases appropriately\n\n3. Development approach:\n   - Start with failing tests to validate requirements\n   - Implement minimal code to make tests pass\n   - Refactor only as needed for clarity and maintainability\n   - Document assumptions and limitations inline\n\n4. Documentation output format:\n   - Summary section with overall assessment\n   - Key successes section with examples\n   - Critical failures section with examples\n   - Prioritized recommendations section\n   - Known limitations section\n\n5. Success criteria:\n   - All tests pass\n   - Documentation is clear and actionable\n   - Implementation is minimal but complete\n   - Code is well-documented with assumptions noted\n</info added on 2025-05-19T21:04:32.960Z>",

Verify tests fail appropriately before implementation\n3. Implement minimal integration function/script for MCP server and CLI tool interaction\n4.
