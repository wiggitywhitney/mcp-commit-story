On-demand directory creation pattern:\n- All summary file-writing operations must use the on-demand directory creation pattern\n- Directories should only be created when needed, not upfront\n- All summary-writing functions (including save_summary) must call ensure_journal_directory(file_path) before writing\n- See docs/on-demand-directory-pattern.md for implementation details and test patterns\n\n8. Manual reflection prioritization:\n- Manual reflections must be prominently displayed at the beginning of summaries\n- Use visual distinction (emoji, formatting) to highlight manual reflections\n- Include date context for each reflection\n- Preserve the original wording of manual reflections\n- Implement reflection extraction from common section patterns\n- Ensure manual reflections are always prioritized over inferred content\n\nNote: This implementation focuses solely on MCP/AI agent operations for summary generation. CLI functionality is limited to setup commands (journal-init, install-hook) only. Refer to updated documentation for details.",

      "details": "This task involves implementing a file-based signaling mechanism in the git hook worker to enable AI clients to discover and execute MCP tools, as well as creating a properly instrumented __main__.py file:\n\n1. **Update Signal Directory Structure**:\n   - Create a function to ensure the `.mcp-commit-story/signals/` directory exists:\n   ```python\n   def ensure_signal_directory():\n       \"\"\"Create the signals directory if it doesn't exist.\"\"\"\n       signal_dir = Path(\".mcp-commit-story/signals\")\n       signal_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n       return signal_dir\n   ```\n\n2. **Signal File Creation**:\n   - Replace the placeholder `call_mcp_tool()` function with signal file creation:\n   ```python\n   def create_signal_file(commit_info, tool_request):\n       \"\"\"Create a signal file for AI clients to discover.\"\"\"\n       metrics = get_mcp_metrics()\n       \n       try:\n           signal_dir = ensure_signal_directory()\n           \n           # Generate unique signal file name with timestamp and commit hash\n           timestamp = int(time.time())\n           signal_file = signal_dir / f\"{timestamp}_{commit_info['hash'][:8]}.json\"\n           \n           # Prepare signal content\n           signal_data = {\n               \"commit\": commit_info,\n               \"tool_request\": tool_request,\n               \"created_at\": timestamp\n           }\n           \n           # Write signal file\n           with open(signal_file, \"w\") as f:\n               json.dump(signal_data, f, indent=2)\n               \n           metrics.record_counter(\"signal_file_created\", 1)\n           logger.info(f\"Created signal file: {signal_file}\")\n           return signal_file\n       except Exception as e:\n           metrics.record_counter(\"signal_file_creation_error\", 1)\n           logger.error(f\"Failed to create signal file: {str(e)}\")\n           # Graceful degradation - never block git operations\n           return None\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Git Hook Worker**:\n   - Modify the main worker function to use the new signal mechanism:\n   ```python\n   def process_commit(repo_path, commit_hash):\n       \"\"\"Process a commit and create signal files for AI clients.\"\"\"\n       metrics = get_mcp_metrics()\n       metrics.record_counter(\"commit_processed\", 1)\n       \n       try:\n           # Get commit information\n           commit_info = get_commit_info(repo_path, commit_hash)\n           \n           # Create signal for journal entry generation\n           create_signal_file(commit_info, {\n               \"tool\": \"journal/generate\",\n               \"params\": {\n                   \"commit_hash\": commit_hash,\n                   \"repo_path\": repo_path\n               }\n           })\n           \n           # Success - return without blocking git\n           return True\n       except Exception as e:\n           metrics.record_counter(\"commit_processing_error\", 1)\n           logger.error(f\"Error processing commit: {str(e)}\")\n           # Graceful degradation - never block git operations\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Signal Format Documentation**:\n   - Add documentation for the signal file format:\n   ```python\n   \"\"\"\n   Signal File Format:\n   {\n       \"commit\": {\n           \"hash\": \"full_commit_hash\",\n           \"short_hash\": \"short_hash\",\n           \"author\": \"Author Name <email@example.com>\",\n           \"message\": \"Commit message\",\n           \"timestamp\": 1234567890\n       },\n       \"tool_request\": {\n           \"tool\": \"journal/generate\",\n           \"params\": {\n               \"commit_hash\": \"full_commit_hash\",\n               \"repo_path\": \"/path/to/repo\"\n           }\n       },\n       \"created_at\": 1234567890\n   }\n   \"\"\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Telemetry Integration**:\n   - Ensure comprehensive telemetry using existing patterns:\n   ```python\n   # Add these metrics to the existing telemetry\n   metrics.record_counter(\"signal_file_created\", 1)\n   metrics.record_counter(\"signal_file_creation_error\", 1)\n   metrics.record_gauge(\"signal_file_size_bytes\", os.path.getsize(signal_file))\n   ```\n\n6. **Error Handling**:\n   - Implement robust error handling to ensure git operations are never blocked:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       # Signal creation logic\n   except Exception as e:\n       metrics.record_counter(\"signal_file_creation_error\", 1)\n       logger.error(f\"Failed to create signal file: {str(e)}\")\n       # Continue without blocking git operations\n   ```\n\n7. **Cleanup Mechanism**:\n   - Add a function to clean up old signal files:\n   ```python\n   def cleanup_old_signals(max_age_hours=24):\n       \"\"\"Remove signal files older than the specified age.\"\"\"\n       try:\n           signal_dir = Path(\".mcp-commit-story/signals\")\n           if not signal_dir.exists():\n               return\n               \n           current_time = time.time()\n           max_age_seconds = max_age_hours * 3600\n           \n           for signal_file in signal_dir.glob(\"*.json\"):\n               file_age = current_time - signal_file.stat().st_mtime\n               if file_age > max_age_seconds:\n                   signal_file.unlink()\n                   logger.debug(f\"Removed old signal file: {signal_file}\")\n       except Exception as e:\n           logger.error(f\"Error cleaning up signal files: {str(e)}\")\n   ```\n\n8. **MCP Server Entry Point Implementation**:\n   - Create `src/mcp_commit_story/__main__.py` as the official entry point:\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python3\n   \"\"\"MCP Commit Story Server Entry Point.\n\n   This module serves as the entry point for the MCP server when invoked via:\n   `python -m mcp_commit_story`\n   \n   It initializes the MCP server with stdio transport, loads configuration,\n   and provides proper error handling and telemetry.\n   \"\"\"\n\n   import sys\n   import logging\n   import traceback\n   from typing import Optional, Dict, Any\n\n   from mcp_commit_story.config import load_config\n   from mcp_commit_story.telemetry import get_mcp_metrics, setup_telemetry\n   from mcp_commit_story.server import MCPServer\n   from mcp_commit_story.transport import StdioTransport\n\n   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n   def main() -> int:\n       \"\"\"Initialize and run the MCP server with stdio transport.\n\n       Returns:\n           int: Exit code (0 for success, non-zero for errors)\n       \"\"\"\n       metrics = get_mcp_metrics()\n       metrics.record_counter(\"server_start_attempt\", 1)\n       \n       try:\n           # Setup logging and telemetry\n           setup_telemetry()\n           logger.info(\"Starting MCP Commit Story server\")\n           \n           # Load configuration\n           config = load_config()\n           logger.debug(f\"Loaded configuration: {config}\")\n           \n           # Initialize transport\n           transport = StdioTransport()\n           logger.info(\"Initialized stdio transport\")\n           \n           # Create and start server\n           server = MCPServer(transport=transport, config=config)\n           metrics.record_counter(\"server_started\", 1)\n           logger.info(\"MCP server initialized, starting main loop\")\n           \n           # Run server (this blocks until server exits)\n           exit_code = server.run()\n           \n           # Clean shutdown\n           metrics.record_counter(\"server_shutdown\", 1)\n           logger.info(f\"MCP server shutdown with exit code {exit_code}\")\n           return exit_code\n           \n       except KeyboardInterrupt:\n           metrics.record_counter(\"server_keyboard_interrupt\", 1)\n           logger.info(\"MCP server interrupted by user\")\n           return 130  # Standard exit code for SIGINT\n           \n       except Exception as e:\n           metrics.record_counter(\"server_startup_error\", 1)\n           logger.error(f\"Error starting MCP server: {str(e)}\")\n           logger.debug(f\"Detailed error: {traceback.format_exc()}\")\n           return 1\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       sys.exit(main())\n   ```\n\n9. **Server Configuration Integration**:\n   -

Change JSON structure in `create_signal_file()`\n2. **`src/mcp_commit_story/git_hook_worker.py`** - Update parameter calls to `create_tool_signal()`  \n3. **Any AI client code** - Update signal reading logic to use on-demand context\n\n### **Specific Function Changes:**\n\n**1. `signal_management.py` - `create_signal_file()` (Lines 157-170)**\n- **REMOVE**: `\"metadata\": commit_metadata` (redundant git context)\n- **REMOVE**: `\"signal_id\": signal_id` (duplicates filename)\n- **ADD**: `\"commit_hash\"` to params for minimal context reference\n\n**2. `git_hook_worker.py` - Update all `create_tool_signal()` calls (Lines 450-490)**\n- **REMOVE**: `{\"repo_path\": repo_path}` parameter (redundant, inferred from location)\n- **CHANGE**: Parameters to be tool-specific only\n- **RESULT**: `commit_hash` gets added to params by signal creation logic\n\n**3. `signal_management.py` - `validate_signal_format()` (Lines 247-265)**\n- **REMOVE**: `\"metadata\": dict` and `\"signal_id\": str` from required fields\n- **KEEP**: `\"tool\": str`, `\"params\": dict`, `\"created_at\": str`\n\n### **Signal Format Change:**\n**Before** (~2KB with PII):\n```json\n{\n  \"tool\": \"journal_new_entry\",\n  \"params\": {\"repo_path\": \"/full/path\"},\n  \"metadata\": {\"hash\": \"abc123\", \"author\": \"User <email>\", \"message\": \"...\", \"files_changed\": [...]},\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-06-11T07:36:12Z\",\n  \"signal_id\": \"20250611_073612_journal_new_entry_abc123\"\n}\n```\n\n**After** (~200 bytes, privacy-safe):\n```json\n{\n  \"tool\": \"journal_new_entry\", \n  \"params\": {\"commit_hash\": \"abc123def456\"},\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-06-11T07:36:12Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### **On-Demand Context Pattern:**\nAI clients fetch git context when needed:\n```python\ncommit_hash = signal_data[\"params\"][\"commit_hash\"]\ncommit_details = git_utils.get_commit_details(commit_hash)\n```\n\n**READY FOR TDD STEP 1: WRITE TESTS FIRST**\n</info added on 2025-06-11T15:38:51.252Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-11T16:02:55.416Z>\n## Implementation Results\n\n### Minimal Signal Format Implementation\n- Successfully reduced signal size from ~2KB to ~200 bytes (90% reduction)\n- Eliminated all PII from signal files (author emails, file paths, commit messages)\n- Implemented privacy-by-design approach with only essential data in signals\n\n### Code Changes\n- Modified `signal_management.py` to use minimal signal format\n- Removed redundant `repo_path` parameter from `journal_new_entry` signals\n- Implemented `create_minimal_signal()` storing only tool name, parameters, commit hash, and timestamp\n- Created `fetch_git_context_on_demand()` utilizing existing git utilities\n- Developed summary trigger logic in `determine_summary_trigger()`\n\n### Testing Results\n- Full test suite passing: 754 tests, 0 failures\n- Fixed all legacy tests to expect minimal format\n- Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Rewrote docs/signal-format.md with minimal signal architecture details\n- Updated PRD to reflect minimal state approach and privacy benefits\n- Enhanced engineering spec with technical implementation details\n\n### Architecture Improvements\n- Privacy-by-design implementation with no sensitive data in signals\n- Minimal state pattern using only essential processing data\n- On-demand context retrieval system using existing git_utils\n- Summary trigger logic for \"AI beast awakening\"\n- Strict validation enforcement for minimal format\n- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation\n</info added on 2025-06-11T16:02:55.416Z>",

      "details": "## Implementation Overview\nThis task involves creating a sophisticated AI-driven context synthesis system that will serve as the fourth pillar in our context collection framework, complementing the existing git, chat, and terminal context sources. The system must include intelligent timing logic to determine when synthesized context is beneficial versus potentially detrimental.\n\n## Phase 1: AI Prompt Engineering\n1. Design a set of specialized prompts that can:\n   - Extract high-level understanding of the current workspace state\n   - Synthesize development session meta-context\n   - Identify relationships between code components\n   - Capture developer intent and workflow patterns\n2. Create a prompt template system that can be dynamically adjusted based on:\n   - Current project type and technology stack\n   - Recent development activities\n   - Detected patterns in coding behavior\n   - Time elapsed since relevant activities\n\n## Phase 2: Context Collection Function\n1. Implement `collectSynthesizedContext()` function that:\n   - Takes inputs from other context sources (git, chat, terminal)\n   - Applies the engineered prompts to an AI model\n   - Processes and structures the AI responses\n   - Returns a rich contextual understanding object\n   - Includes metadata about context freshness and relevance\n2. Optimize prompt execution to minimize latency:\n   - Implement caching for similar contexts\n   - Use streaming responses where appropriate\n   - Consider batching context requests\n\n## Phase 3: Integration with Context Collection System\n1. Modify the main context collection pipeline to include the new AI synthesized source:\n   ```typescript\n   async function collectAllContext() {\n     const [gitContext, chatContext, terminalContext, synthesizedContext] = await Promise.all([\n       collectGitContext(),\n       collectChatContext(),\n       collectTerminalContext(),\n       collectSynthesizedContext() // New fourth source\n     ]);\n     \n     return {\n       git: gitContext,\n       chat: chatContext,\n       terminal: terminalContext,\n       synthesized: synthesizedContext // New context type\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n2. Update context merging and prioritization logic to incorporate synthesized insights\n3. Implement fallback mechanisms for when AI synthesis is unavailable or low quality\n\n## Phase 4: Context Enhancement Features\n1. Develop specialized extractors for different context types:\n   - Workspace context: project structure, file relationships, architecture patterns\n   - Session context: current development flow, task switching patterns\n   - Code context: semantic understanding of code beyond syntax\n   - Meta-context: developer intent, problem-solving approaches\n2. Create a context scoring system to prioritize most relevant synthesized insights\n\n## Phase 5: Journal Entry Enrichment\n1. Modify journal entry generation to leverage synthesized context:\n   - Include AI-generated summaries of development sessions\n   - Highlight key insights about code changes and their purpose\n   - Provide higher-level abstractions of development activities\n2. Implement configurable verbosity levels for synthesized context in journal entries\n\n## Phase 6: Timing-Aware Context Relevance\n1. Research and implement a time-decay model for context relevance:\n   - Track timestamps for all context sources\n   - Calculate relevance scores based on recency\n   - Determine thresholds for when context becomes potentially detrimental\n2. Decision point implementation:\n   - Collection-time approach: Only collect synthesized context when time thresholds indicate it would be valuable\n   - Processing-time approach: Always collect but include relevance metadata for downstream filtering\n   - Hybrid approach: Basic collection-time filtering with more nuanced processing-time decisions\n3. Implement adaptive thresholds based on:\n   - Project type and development patterns\n   - Historical usefulness of synthesized context\n   - User feedback and preferences",
      "testStrategy": "## Testing Approach\n\n### Unit Tests\n1. Create unit tests for the `collectSynthesizedContext()` function:\n   - Test with various mock inputs from other context sources\n   - Verify correct prompt construction and AI request formatting\n   - Validate proper handling of AI response parsing\n   - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms\n\n2. Test context integration:\n   - Verify synthesized context is correctly merged with other context sources\n   - Test prioritization logic when contexts overlap or conflict\n   - Ensure performance remains acceptable with the additional context source\n\n3. Test timing-aware relevance logic:\n   - Verify correct calculation of time-based relevance scores\n   - Test with various time intervals between context collection and usage\n   - Validate threshold logic for inclusion/exclusion decisions\n\n### Integration Tests\n1. End-to-end testing of the complete context collection pipeline:\n   - Verify all four context sources are collected and integrated properly\n   - Test with various real-world development scenarios\n   - Measure and optimize performance impact\n\n2. Journal entry generation tests:\n   - Verify synthesized context appears appropriately in journal entries\n   - Test different verbosity settings for synthesized context\n   - Compare journal quality before and after implementation\n   - Verify correct handling of time-delayed journal generation\n\n### Quality Assessment\n1. Implement a scoring system to evaluate synthesized context quality:\n   - Relevance to current development tasks\n   - Uniqueness compared to other context sources\n   - Insight value beyond raw data\n   - Accuracy of meta-context understanding\n   - Correlation between time elapsed and context quality\n\n2. Conduct user testing:\n   - Have developers review journal entries with synthesized context\n   - Collect feedback on usefulness and accuracy\n   - Measure impact on development workflow and documentation quality\n   - Specifically test scenarios with varying time delays\n\n### Performance Testing\n1. Benchmark latency impact:\n   - Measure additional time required for AI synthesis\n   - Test with various project sizes and complexity levels\n   - Optimize for minimal impact on journal generation time\n\n2. Resource utilization testing:\n   - Monitor memory usage during context collection\n   - Verify CPU usage remains within acceptable limits\n   - Test on different hardware configurations\n\n### Time-Relevance Testing\n1. Create test scenarios with controlled time delays:\n   - Immediate journal generation after commit\n   - Short delays (minutes to hours)\n   - Long delays (days)\n   - Very long delays (weeks)\n2. Evaluate quality and relevance of synthesized context across these scenarios\n3. Validate that the system correctly identifies when to include vs. exclude synthesized context",

      "details": "This task addresses fundamental architecture questions that impact the overall system design and user experience.\n\n## Research Questions\n\n### 1. Chat Parsing Location Architecture\n- Evaluate whether intelligent parsing guided by git code/file changes should happen at collection time or downstream during journal generation\n- Analyze tradeoffs between collection-time vs processing-time parsing:\n  - Collection-time: More immediate processing, potentially higher upfront cost\n  - Processing-time: Deferred processing, potentially more flexible but complex caching\n- Document impact on caching strategies, performance metrics, and system flexibility\n- Assess implications for debugging, troubleshooting, and error handling\n\n### 2. Terminal Commands Value Assessment\n- Conduct quantitative analysis of existing journal entries to determine value-add of terminal commands\n- Calculate percentage of journal entries that meaningfully benefit from terminal command context\n- Evaluate complexity cost vs user benefit of terminal command collection\n- Document specific use cases where terminal commands provide:\n  - Essential context (cannot be omitted)\n  - Supplementary value (nice-to-have)\n  - Minimal value (could be omitted)\n\n### 3. Performance and Scalability Considerations\n- Benchmark performance characteristics of different parsing strategies\n- Measure scaling behavior with:\n  - Large repositories (10,000+ files)\n  - Extended chat histories (1000+ messages)\n  - Complex commit patterns\n- Document memory usage, processing time, and resource requirements\n\n## Research Methodology\n1. Create test datasets representing various repository sizes and chat complexities\n2. Implement prototype implementations of both parsing approaches:\n   ```python\n   # Collection-time parsing approach\n   @trace_mcp_operation\n   def parse_chat_at_collection(chat_data, git_changes):\n       \"\"\"Parse chat data at collection time using git changes as context\"\"\"\n       relevant_segments = []\n       # Implementation logic\n       return relevant_segments\n   \n   # Processing-time parsing approach\n   @trace_mcp_operation\n   def parse_chat_at_processing(chat_data, git_changes):\n       \"\"\"Parse chat data during journal generation using git changes as context\"\"\"\n       relevant_segments = []\n       # Implementation logic\n       return relevant_segments\n   ```\n3. Develop metrics collection framework to measure:\n   - Processing time\n   - Memory usage\n   - Cache hit/miss rates\n   - Accuracy of relevant chat identification\n4. Create terminal command value assessment framework:\n   ```python\n   @trace_mcp_operation\n   def analyze_terminal_command_value(journal_entries):\n       \"\"\"Analyze the value contribution of terminal commands in journal entries\"\"\"\n       value_metrics = {\n           \"essential\": 0,\n           \"supplementary\": 0, \n           \"minimal\": 0\n       }\n       # Implementation logic\n       return value_metrics\n   ```\n\n## Deliverables\n1.

Documentation Testing\n- **Documentation Completeness Check**:\n  - Create a checklist of required documentation sections\n  - Verify each section exists and contains appropriate content\n  - Use automated tools to check for broken links or references\n\n- **Documentation Accuracy Testing**:\n  - Have team members follow documentation to perform key tasks\n  - Record any points of confusion or missing information\n  - Update documentation based on feedback\n\n- **Code-Documentation Consistency**:\n  ```python\n  def test_api_documentation_matches_implementation():\n      \"\"\"Verify API documentation matches actual implementation\"\"\"\n      from src import chat_integration\n      import inspect\n      \n      # Load API documentation (from markdown or docstrings)\n      api_docs = load_api_documentation()\n      \n      # Check each documented function exists\n      for func_name in api_docs:\n          assert hasattr(chat_integration, func_name), f\"Documented function {func_name} doesn't exist\"\n          \n          # Check parameters match\n          func = getattr(chat_integration, func_name)\n          sig = inspect.signature(func)\n          doc_params = api_docs[func_name]['parameters']\n          \n          for param_name in sig.parameters:\n              if param_name != 'self':\n                  assert param_name in doc_params, f\"Parameter {param_name} not documented for {func_name}\"\n  ```\n\n### 3. System Cleanup Testing\n- **Deprecated Code Removal Verification**:\n  ```python\n  def test_deprecated_functions_removed():\n      \"\"\"Verify deprecated functions have been removed\"\"\"\n      from src import context_collection\n      \n      # Check specific functions are removed\n      assert not hasattr(context_collection, 'collect_ai_chat_context'), \"Deprecated function still exists\"\n      \n      # Check for TODO comments\n      with open('src/context_collection.py', 'r') as f:\n          content = f.read()\n          assert \"TODO: Remove\" not in content, \"Cleanup TODOs still exist\"\n  ```\n\n- **Code Quality Checks**:\n  - Run linters (flake8, pylint) with strict settings\n  - Verify consistent code formatting with black or similar tool\n  - Check for consistent import ordering\n\n- **Error Message Testing**:\n  ```python\n  def test_error_messages_are_user_friendly():\n      \"\"\"Verify error messages are user-friendly\"\"\"\n      # Test various error conditions\n      try:\n          chat_integration.extract_chat_context(None, [])\n      except Exception as e:\n          error_msg = str(e)\n          # Check error message quality\n          assert \"technical details: \" not in error_msg.lower(), \"Error contains technical jargon\"\n          assert len(error_msg) > 20, \"Error message too short to be helpful\"\n          assert \"how to fix\" in error_msg.lower() or \"try\" in error_msg.lower(), \"Error lacks remediation advice\"\n  ```\n\n### 4. Final Validation\n- **End-to-End System Test**:\n  - Create a complete workflow test that exercises all components\n  - Verify system works correctly with real-world data\n  - Test with various edge cases and error conditions\n\n- **Cross-Platform Testing**:\n  - Verify functionality on all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n  - Test with different Python versions\n  - Validate with different database versions and configurations\n\n- **Performance Regression Testing**:\n  - Compare performance metrics before and after changes\n  - Verify no significant performance degradation\n  - Test with large datasets to ensure scalability",
