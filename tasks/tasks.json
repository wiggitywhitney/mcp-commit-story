Current State of src/mcp_journal/git_utils.py\n- Functions implemented: is_git_repo, get_repo, get_current_commit, is_journal_only_commit, get_commit_details\n- Code style: Uses docstrings, type hints, error handling, and conditional import of GitPython. Follows project conventions.\n- Missing functions (per spec/task): get_commit_diff_summary, install_post_commit_hook, backup_existing_hook, get_commits_since_last_entry\n\n2. Dependencies\n- GitPython is conditionally imported and used. Should be present in pyproject.toml (verify and add if missing).\n\n3. Test Coverage\n- Test file: tests/unit/test_git_utils.py exists and is substantial (140 lines).\n- Coverage: Tests for existing functions likely present, but not for missing functions. No test fixtures for git repo manipulation in tests/fixtures/.\n- Recommendation: Create pytest fixtures for temporary git repositories to support robust TDD for new and existing functions.\n\n4. Summary of Gaps and Immediate Needs\n- Gaps: Several required functions are not yet implemented or stubbed. No test fixtures for git repo setup/teardown. Need to verify GitPython is in pyproject.toml.\n- Immediate needs before further TDD: Add/verify GitPython in dependencies. Create pytest fixture for temporary git repos.

This function returns a structured dictionary containing all git data needed for journal entries.\n  - Use get_current_commit, get_commit_details, and get_commit_diff_summary from git_utils.py as the foundation.\n  - The returned dictionary should include: metadata (from get_commit_details), diff_summary (from get_commit_diff_summary), file_stats (count of different file types), and commit_context (merge status, commit size classification).\n- **Enhanced File Analysis:**\n  - Add helper functions to classify files by type (source code, config, docs, tests) and determine commit size (small/medium/large based on total lines changed). Keep analysis simple and journal-appropriate.\n- **Integration Points:**\n  - Update any code in journal.py that calls the mock functions to use collect_git_context instead, following the context collection pattern of collect_chat_history and collect_ai_terminal_commands.\n- **TypedDict Definition:**\n  - As part of Task 5.11, define a TypedDict for the git context structure to provide proper type hints and documentation for downstream section generators.\n- **Implementation Priority:**\n  - Start with basic functionality using existing git_utils functions, then add file classification and commit size analysis as enhancements. Do not implement full diff parsing or line-by-line analysis.\n- **Documentation Updates:**\n  - Update the engineering spec section on \"Data Sources\" to include git context collection. Add git context to context collection code examples in Task 5. Update function docstrings in journal.py to reference the new git context structure.

      "description": "Currently the journal initialization creates all subdirectories upfront (daily/, summaries/weekly/, etc.), resulting in empty folders that may never be used. Refactor to create directories only when first needed, providing a cleaner user experience and more natural growth pattern.\n\nScope:\n1. Initialization Changes:\n   - Modify `initialize_journal()` to create only base `journal/` directory\n   - Update or remove `create_journal_directories()` function\n   - Update tests in `test_journal_init.py` and integration tests\n2. Existing Operations Updates:\n   - Ensure `append_to_journal_file()` creates needed directories\n   - Update `get_journal_file_path()` and related functions\n   - Update any current file operations that assume directories exist\n3. Test Updates:\n   - Unit tests for new initialization behavior\n   - Integration tests for on-demand directory creation\n   - Error handling tests for permission issues during creation\n4. Documentation Updates:\n   - Update `docs/journal_init.md`\n   - Update PRD and engineering spec\n   - Update function docstrings\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Journal initialization creates only base `journal/` directory\n- Existing journal operations create needed subdirectories automatically\n- No functionality regression in current features\n- All tests pass\n- Documentation reflects new behavior\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Use existing pattern: `file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`\n- Maintain same error handling standards\n- Follow strict TDD approach\n- Create helper function: Consider adding a reusable `ensure_journal_directory(file_path)` utility function\n- Update acceptance criteria for dependent tasks: Tasks 5, 10, 11 should include \"creates needed directories automatically\" in their acceptance criteria when implemented\n\nFuture Task Updates Needed:\n- Task 5 (Journal Entry Generation): Add directory creation requirement\n- Task 10 (Manual Reflection Addition): Add directory creation requirement  \n- Task 11 (Summary Generation): Add directory creation requirement for all summary types\n- Any other tasks that write to journal files\n\nFollow the existing TDD patterns in the codebase and maintain the same error handling and documentation standards.",
