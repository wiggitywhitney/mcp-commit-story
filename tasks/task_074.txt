# Task ID: 74
# Title: Create Multi-Layered Entertaining Demo for Git Hook → Journal Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 69
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an entertaining, multi-layered demo showing the complete git hook → journal workflow for codebase presentation, combining multiple demo elements to tell a cohesive story of progressive codebase cleanup

# Requirements:
- Create multiple demo elements that can be combined into a cohesive demonstration flow
- Show git hook triggering journal entry creation through multiple commit cycles
- Demonstrate chat integration with AI context capture workflow
- Include manual reflection addition to show complete journal ecosystem
- Make demo memorable, engaging, and fun for presentation audience
- Ensure predictable, reliable results for live demonstration
- Show before/after workflow states clearly at each stage
- Demonstrate multiple aspects of the journal system (commits, AI chat, reflections, prompts)

# Notes:
## Initial Context:
- Demo scheduled for tomorrow's presentation - 2025-07-14 22:09 CDT
- Should demonstrate core value proposition of git hook → journal workflow
- Multiple demo elements can be combined (not mutually exclusive)
- Focus on showing concrete before/after states rather than just theory
- Need to balance entertainment value with professional presentation requirements

## Potential Demo Elements Identified:
1. **Baklava References**: Hidden throughout codebase in comments, function names, documentation
2. **Rick Roll Console Logs**: Console logs that spell out "Never gonna give you up" during journal generation
3. **AI Prompt Modifications**: Temporary prompt changes (southern drawl, Office quotes, etc.)
4. **Chat Integration**: Show AI conversation → context capture → journal integration
5. **Manual Reflections**: Demonstrate reflection addition workflow
6. **Progressive Cleanup**: Show multiple commit cycles of improvement

## Success Criteria:
- Demonstrates complete git hook → journal workflow end-to-end
- Shows multiple system capabilities (commits, chat, reflections, AI customization)
- Reliable and predictable for live presentation
- Engaging and memorable for audience
- Professional but entertaining tone

# Design Decisions for Future Consideration:
- Which specific demo elements to implement and in what combination
- Optimal sequencing of demo phases for maximum impact
- Where to place each type of demo element for best demonstration effect
- How many commit cycles to show (balance between comprehensive and concise)
- Whether to include AI prompt modification (currently not user-configurable)
- What additional creative demo elements beyond the initial three options
- Integration approach for chat → context capture → journal workflow
