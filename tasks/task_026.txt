# Task ID: 26
# Title: Create Packaging Strategy and Release Process for MVP Launch
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive packaging and distribution strategy for the MCP Commit Story MVP, including PyPI publishing, version management, installation methods, and release processes.
# Details:
This task involves creating a complete packaging strategy and implementation plan for the MCP Commit Story MVP launch:

1. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Set up PyPI package configuration with appropriate metadata in setup.py/pyproject.toml
   - Implement semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with version tracking in a dedicated file
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated releases using GitHub Actions or similar
   - Define package dependencies with appropriate version constraints
   - Create package structure with proper namespacing

2. **Installation Methods**:
   - Implement standard pip installation: `pip install mcp-commit-story`
   - Create development installation process: `pip install -e .` with dev dependencies
   - Document MCP server deployment options (standalone, Docker, etc.)
   - Write detailed configuration guides for different environments

3. **Release Process**:
   - Implement automated version tagging and changelog generation
   - Create pre-release testing checklist and validation procedures
   - Set up documentation update workflow tied to releases
   - Document rollback procedures for failed releases
   - Establish release branch strategy (e.g., release/v1.0.0)

4. **User Experience Documentation**:
   - Write comprehensive getting started guide
   - Create integration examples for VSCode, PyCharm, and command line
   - Develop troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
   - Set up community support channels (GitHub Discussions, Discord, etc.)

5. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Define package structure with clear entry points
   - Implement dependency management with compatibility matrices
   - Create environment testing matrix (OS, Python versions)
   - Document performance benchmarks and minimum requirements
   - Ensure journal entry functionality is properly packaged and accessible

Implementation should follow Python packaging best practices and ensure the journal entry creation functionality from Task 9 is properly exposed and documented in the package.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the packaging strategy and release process:

1. **Package Structure Testing**:
   - Validate package structure using `check-manifest`
   - Verify all necessary files are included in the distribution
   - Test package installation in a clean virtual environment
   - Confirm entry points work as expected after installation

2. **Release Process Validation**:
   - Perform a test release to TestPyPI
   - Verify version bumping and changelog generation
   - Test the release automation pipeline with a pre-release version
   - Validate rollback procedures with a simulated failed release

3. **Installation Testing**:
   - Test pip installation on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Verify development installation for contributors
   - Test MCP server deployment using the documented methods
   - Validate configuration options work as described

4. **Documentation Review**:
   - Conduct user testing with the getting started guide
   - Review integration examples for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify troubleshooting documentation addresses common issues
   - Test community support channels are properly set up

5. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Verify journal entry creation (from Task 9) works correctly after package installation
   - Test all documented features are accessible through the package
   - Validate performance meets the documented benchmarks
   - Ensure compatibility with all supported Python versions and environments

The packaging strategy is considered complete when a test user can successfully install and use the package following only the provided documentation.
