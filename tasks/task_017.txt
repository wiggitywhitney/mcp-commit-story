# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Daily Summary Generation Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to generate summaries for a single day in the journal system via CLI and MCP tool, with consideration for auto-generating summaries for days with new commits.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. CLI Enhancement:
   - Add a new '--day' or '--date' option to the CLI interface that accepts date input in a standard format (YYYY-MM-DD) and stores daily summaries in journal/summaries/daily/
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing CLI commands
   - Implement proper error handling for invalid date formats or dates with no journal entries
   - Add help documentation for the new option

2. MCP Tool Integration:
   - Add corresponding UI elements in the MCP tool to select a specific day for summary generation
   - Implement date picker or similar intuitive interface for date selection
   - Ensure the UI provides clear feedback during and after summary generation

3. Summary Generation Logic:
   - Create a dedicated function for single-day summary generation
   - Reuse existing summary algorithms but optimize for single-day context
   - Ensure manual reflections are prioritized in the summary (as per Task #16)
   - Include relevant statistics for the day (commit count, activity patterns)
   - Format the output consistently with other summary types

4. Auto-generation Feature (Optional):
   - Implement a configuration option (auto_summarize) to enable/disable auto-generation
   - Create a mechanism to detect if new commits were added for a previous day
   - Design a background process or trigger to generate summaries automatically
   - Ensure users are notified of auto-generated summaries
   - Allow users to configure the time window for when auto-generation occurs

5. Storage and Retrieval:
   - Design a consistent storage approach for daily summaries in journal/summaries/daily/
   - Implement efficient retrieval methods for viewing past daily summaries
   - Consider caching mechanisms for frequently accessed summaries

6. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize the summary generation for speed, especially for days with many entries
   - Implement progress indicators for longer operations

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the daily summary feature:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the date parsing and validation logic
   - Verify the summary generation algorithm produces correct output for various input scenarios
   - Test edge cases: empty days, days with single entries, days with many entries
   - Verify proper handling of manual reflections prioritization

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the CLI interface with various date formats and options
   - Verify the MCP tool correctly interfaces with the summary generation logic
   - Test the auto-generation feature triggers correctly when enabled
   - Verify storage and retrieval of daily summaries works as expected

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common user workflows
   - Verify the feature works with the journal system's existing data
   - Test with different user permission levels if applicable

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and benchmark summary generation time for various day sizes
   - Test auto-generation impact on system resources
   - Verify the system remains responsive during summary generation

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing summary features (weekly, monthly) continue to work
   - Verify that the prioritization of manual reflections works consistently

6. Automated Test Suite:
   - Add new test cases to the comprehensive testing suite (from Task #15)
   - Create specific test fixtures for daily summary testing

7. Documentation Testing:
   - Verify help documentation accurately describes the new options
   - Test that error messages are clear and actionable
