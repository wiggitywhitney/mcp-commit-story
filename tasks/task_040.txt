# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Git-Driven Chat Relevance Detection System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 47
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an innovative system that uses git changes as semantic search criteria to find relevant chat segments in the complete conversation history.
# Details:
This task implements a groundbreaking git-driven chat relevance detection system that intelligently connects code changes with relevant discussion history. The system will analyze git diffs to extract key information and match it with chat content from the Cursor chat database.

1. **Git Diff Analysis Module**:
```python
@trace_mcp_operation
def extract_code_elements_from_diff(diff_content):
    """Extract key terms, function names, and concepts from git diff content"""
    # Parse diff to identify added/removed/modified code
    # Extract function names, variable names, and key terms
    # Return structured representation of code elements
```

2. **Semantic Matching Engine**:
```python
@trace_mcp_operation
def create_semantic_vectors(text_content):
    """Convert text content to semantic vectors for matching"""
    # Use NLP techniques to create semantic representations
    # Consider using embeddings or other semantic analysis approaches
    # Return vector representation of text content
    
@trace_mcp_operation
def calculate_relevance_score(code_elements, chat_segment):
    """Calculate relevance score between code elements and chat segment"""
    # Implement scoring algorithm based on semantic similarity
    # Consider exact matches, fuzzy matches, and conceptual relevance
    # Return normalized score between 0 and 1
```

3. **Chat Segment Ranking System**:
```python
@trace_mcp_operation
def rank_chat_segments(code_elements, chat_segments, config):
    """Rank chat segments by relevance to code elements"""
    # Calculate relevance scores for each segment
    # Apply time-based weighting (recent discussions may be more relevant)
    # Apply configurable thresholds from config
    # Return sorted list of segments with scores
```

4. **Configuration Management**:
```python
def load_relevance_detection_config():
    """Load configuration for relevance detection"""
    # Load from config file or use defaults
    # Include thresholds, weights, and other parameters
    # Return configuration dictionary
```

5. **Integration with Cursor Chat Database**:
```python
@trace_mcp_operation
def get_relevant_chat_segments(diff_content, config):
    """Main function to get relevant chat segments for a git diff"""
    # Extract code elements from diff
    code_elements = extract_code_elements_from_diff(diff_content)
    
    # Get chat history from database
    chat_segments = get_chat_segments_from_db()
    
    # Rank segments by relevance
    ranked_segments = rank_chat_segments(code_elements, chat_segments, config)
    
    # Return top segments based on threshold
    return filter_segments_by_threshold(ranked_segments, config["relevance_threshold"])
```

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed chat segments
   - Use efficient vector operations for semantic matching
   - Consider batch processing for large chat histories

7. **Telemetry and Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive telemetry as defined in docs/telemetry.md
   - Log key metrics such as processing time, match quality, and segment counts
   - Track user interactions with suggested segments for future improvements

8. **Configuration Options**:
   - Relevance threshold (0.0-1.0)
   - Time decay factor for older chat segments
   - Maximum number of segments to return
   - Minimum segment length to consider
   - Fuzzy matching tolerance

# Test Strategy:
The test strategy for the Git-Driven Chat Relevance Detection System will include:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each component function independently with mock inputs
   - Verify correct extraction of code elements from sample diffs
   - Validate semantic matching with known text pairs
   - Confirm proper ranking of chat segments with controlled inputs

```python
def test_extract_code_elements():
    """Test extraction of code elements from git diff"""
    sample_diff = """
    diff --git a/src/module.py b/src/module.py
    index abc123..def456 100644
    --- a/src/module.py
    +++ b/src/module.py

         def calculate_total(items):
             return sum(item.price for item in items)
    +    def apply_discount(total, rate):
    +        return total * (1 - rate)
    """
    elements = extract_code_elements_from_diff(sample_diff)
    assert "calculate_total" in elements["function_names"]
    assert "apply_discount" in elements["function_names"]
    assert "rate" in elements["variable_names"]
```

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the complete pipeline from diff to relevant chat segments
   - Use the TelemetryCollector framework to validate correct operation
   - Verify proper integration with the Cursor chat database

```python
def test_end_to_end_relevance_detection():
    """Test complete relevance detection pipeline"""
    with TelemetryCollector() as collector:
        # Setup test environment with sample diff and chat history
        diff_content = load_test_diff()
        setup_mock_chat_database()
        
        # Run the relevance detection
        relevant_segments = get_relevant_chat_segments(diff_content, test_config)
        
        # Verify results
        assert len(relevant_segments) > 0
        assert relevant_segments[0]["score"] > 0.7
        
        # Verify telemetry
        assert collector.has_operation("extract_code_elements_from_diff")
        assert collector.has_operation("calculate_relevance_score")
```

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Test with large chat histories (1000+ messages)
   - Measure and validate processing time stays within acceptable limits
   - Verify memory usage remains reasonable

```python
def test_performance_with_large_history():
    """Test performance with large chat history"""
    large_history = generate_large_chat_history(1000)
    setup_mock_chat_database(large_history)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    relevant_segments = get_relevant_chat_segments(sample_diff, test_config)
    processing_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert processing_time < 2.0  # Should complete in under 2 seconds
    assert sys.getsizeof(relevant_segments) < 1024 * 1024  # Memory usage check
```

4. **Cross-Platform Tests**:
   - Verify functionality on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Test with different Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
   - Ensure consistent behavior across environments

5. **Edge Case Tests**:
   - Test with empty diffs
   - Test with extremely large diffs
   - Test with chat history containing code snippets
   - Test with non-English chat content
   - Test with malformed chat database

6. **Manual Validation**:
   - Conduct user testing to verify relevance of suggested chat segments
   - Compare algorithm results with human judgment of relevance
   - Collect feedback on false positives and false negatives
