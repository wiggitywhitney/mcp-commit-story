# Task ID: 54
# Title: Clean Up Obsolete Signal-Based Architecture Code
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove all obsolete code, files, and references from the old signal-based architecture after MVP functionality is complete with the new direct git hook → standalone generator architecture.
# Details:
This cleanup task should systematically remove all components of the abandoned signal-based approach:

1. **Signal File Handling**:
   - Remove all signal file creation, reading, and processing functions
   - Delete any signal file templates and related resources
   - Remove signal file path configurations and constants

2. **MCP Tool Signaling Mechanisms**:
   - Remove MCP signal handling code in the server
   - Delete signal-based MCP tools and their registration functions
   - Clean up any signal-based command processing logic

3. **File Watcher Patterns**:
   - Remove file watchers specifically designed for signal files
   - Clean up any event handlers tied to signal file detection
   - Delete configuration related to signal file monitoring

4. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Update imports to remove references to signal modules
   - Remove unused functions and classes related to signaling
   - Clean up test files that were testing signal functionality
   - Remove signal creation/processing logic throughout the codebase

5. **Directory and File Cleanup**:
   - Delete signal file directories if they're no longer needed
   - Remove any temporary or cache directories used for signal processing
   - Update documentation to remove references to the signal architecture

6. **Configuration Cleanup**:
   - Remove signal-related configuration options
   - Update default configurations to reflect the new architecture
   - Clean up environment variables related to signal processing

7. **Dependency Updates**:
   - Remove any external dependencies only used for signal processing
   - Update requirements files to remove unnecessary packages

The goal is to have a clean codebase that only contains code supporting the new direct git hook → standalone generator architecture, improving maintainability and reducing confusion for future development.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the successful completion of this cleanup task:

1. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - Run a grep or similar tool to search for signal-related terms across the codebase
   - Verify no references to signal files, signal processing, or signal directories remain
   - Check for any orphaned imports or unused functions

2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify all core functionality works without the signal architecture:
     - Journal generation triggers correctly from git hooks
     - Daily summaries generate properly using the standalone approach
     - All data collection works through direct database access

3. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Ensure configuration files don't contain obsolete signal-related settings
   - Verify environment variables documentation is updated
   - Check that default configurations are appropriate for the new architecture

4. **Import Analysis**:
   - Run an import analyzer to ensure no imports reference deleted modules
   - Verify no circular dependencies were created during cleanup

5. **Test Suite Execution**:
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no functionality was broken
   - Verify tests don't reference signal-based functionality
   - Ensure test coverage remains high for core functionality

6. **Code Size Metrics**:
   - Compare codebase size before and after cleanup
   - Document the reduction in lines of code and number of files

7. **Documentation Review**:
   - Verify all documentation is updated to reflect the new architecture
   - Ensure no references to signals remain in comments or docstrings

8. **Git Hook Verification**:
   - Test git hooks to ensure they properly trigger journal and summary generation
   - Verify hooks don't attempt to use any signal-based functionality
