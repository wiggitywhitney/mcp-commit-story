# Task ID: 23
# Title: Refactor Journal Directory Creation to On-Demand Pattern
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Currently the journal initialization creates all subdirectories upfront (daily/, summaries/weekly/, etc.), resulting in empty folders that may never be used. Refactor to create directories only when first needed, providing a cleaner user experience and more natural growth pattern.

Scope:
1. Initialization Changes:
   - Modify `initialize_journal()` to create only base `journal/` directory
   - Update or remove `create_journal_directories()` function
   - Update tests in `test_journal_init.py` and integration tests
2. Existing Operations Updates:
   - Ensure `append_to_journal_file()` creates needed directories
   - Update `get_journal_file_path()` and related functions
   - Update any current file operations that assume directories exist
3. Test Updates:
   - Unit tests for new initialization behavior
   - Integration tests for on-demand directory creation
   - Error handling tests for permission issues during creation
4. Documentation Updates:
   - Update `docs/journal_init.md`
   - Update PRD and engineering spec
   - Update function docstrings

Acceptance Criteria:
- Journal initialization creates only base `journal/` directory
- Existing journal operations create needed subdirectories automatically
- No functionality regression in current features
- All tests pass
- Documentation reflects new behavior

Implementation Notes:
- Use existing pattern: `file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`
- Maintain same error handling standards
- Follow strict TDD approach
- Create helper function: Consider adding a reusable `ensure_journal_directory(file_path)` utility function
- Update acceptance criteria for dependent tasks: Tasks 5, 10, 11 should include "creates needed directories automatically" in their acceptance criteria when implemented

Future Task Updates Needed:
- Task 5 (Journal Entry Generation): Add directory creation requirement
- Task 10 (Manual Reflection Addition): Add directory creation requirement  
- Task 11 (Summary Generation): Add directory creation requirement for all summary types
- Any other tasks that write to journal files

Follow the existing TDD patterns in the codebase and maintain the same error handling and documentation standards.

Description: Complete all documentation updates and prepare guidance for future tasks. Remove upfront directory creation from Task 5 components and ensure full compliance with on-demand pattern.
Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4
TDD Steps:
1. WRITE TESTS FIRST

  - All functions have updated docstrings mentioning on-demand behavior where relevant
  - Engineering spec contains complete on-demand pattern documentation
  - Task guidance documents exist and are accessible
  - create_journal_directories() function is properly deprecated/removed
  - No remaining code calls the deprecated directory creation function
- Add tests to verify Task 5 compliance with on-demand pattern:
  - Test that create_journal_directories() is no longer used in initialization
  - Test that file operations work without upfront directory creation
- RUN TESTS - VERIFY THEY FAIL
2. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY
Task 5 Component Updates:
- Remove/Deprecate create_journal_directories() function in journal.py:

- Update Task 5 tests that assume upfront directory creation:
  - Remove calls to create_journal_directories() in test setup
  - Verify tests pass with on-demand directory creation
- Update docstrings in Task 5 functions to mention on-demand behavior:
  - append_to_journal_file() - already mentions ensure_journal_directory()
  - Any other functions that interact with journal file structure
Documentation Updates:
- Update engineering-mcp-journal-spec-final.md with complete on-demand pattern section:
  - Document the ensure_journal_directory() utility function
  - Explain when and how to use it
  - Update file operation examples to show on-demand pattern
- Create docs/on-demand-directory-pattern.md with implementation guidance:
  - Code examples for proper usage
  - Anti-patterns to avoid
  - Integration with existing file operations
- Update function docstrings in journal.py and journal_init.py:
  - Ensure all file operation functions document on-demand behavior
  - Update examples in docstrings
Future Task Guidance:

  - Task 11 (Summary Generation): Update save_summary() to use ensure_journal_directory() for all summary types (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
  - Task 22 (Remaining MCP Server Handlers): Ensure MCP handlers use on-demand pattern when writing files
- Update tasks.json with specific guidance for each dependent task
- RUN TESTS - VERIFY THEY PASS
