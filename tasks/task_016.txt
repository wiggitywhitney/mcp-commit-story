# Task ID: 16
# Title: Prioritize Manual Reflections in Summary Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the summary generation algorithm to prioritize user-added manual reflections over inferred content in daily, weekly, and monthly summaries, ensuring that intentional user input is prominently displayed.
# Details:
This task involves restructuring the summary generation process to give precedence to manual reflections. Key implementation details include:

1. Identify all manual reflections within the summary period (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. Modify the summary template to include a dedicated "Manual Reflections" section at the beginning of each summary
3. Apply visual highlighting (e.g., different formatting, color, or icons) to distinguish manual reflections from inferred content
4. Update the sorting algorithm to prioritize manual reflections chronologically at the top of summaries
5. Ensure that inferred mood, tone, or accomplishments appear after manual reflections, with clear visual separation
6. Implement fallback logic for periods with no manual reflections to gracefully handle this case
7. Update the summary preview functionality to reflect these changes
8. Maintain backward compatibility with existing summary data structures
9. Document the changes in the summary generation process for future reference
10. Consider adding a configuration option to allow users to toggle this behavior if desired

The implementation should build upon the existing manual reflection functionality from Task #13 and integrate with the current summary generation system.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Verify that manual reflections are correctly identified and extracted from journal entries
   - Test the sorting algorithm to ensure manual reflections appear before inferred content
   - Validate that the summary template correctly positions manual reflections at the beginning

2. Integration tests:
   - Create test journals with various combinations of manual and inferred content
   - Generate summaries for different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) and verify correct prioritization
   - Test edge cases: summaries with only manual reflections, only inferred content, or no content at all

3. UI/UX tests:
   - Verify that manual reflections are visually distinct and prominently displayed in the UI
   - Test that the visual hierarchy clearly communicates the importance of manual reflections
   - Ensure responsive design maintains this prioritization across different devices and screen sizes

4. User acceptance testing:
   - Create test scenarios with sample journal data containing both manual reflections and inferred content
   - Have test users review summaries to confirm that manual reflections are more noticeable
   - Collect feedback on the effectiveness of the prioritization implementation

5. Regression testing:
   - Verify that existing summary functionality remains intact
   - Ensure that historical summaries can be regenerated with the new prioritization rules if needed

Document all test results with screenshots comparing before and after implementations.
