# Task ID: 16
# Title: Rename Python Package from 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story'
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Rename the Python package from 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story' to align with the repository name, including all necessary code and configuration updates to maintain functionality.
# Details:
This task involves a straightforward package rename to ensure consistency between the codebase and repository name. The developer should:

1. Rename the source directory from 'src/mcp_journal/' to 'src/mcp_commit_story/'
2. Update all import statements throughout the codebase, including:
   - Internal imports within the package
   - Import statements in test files
   - Any examples or documentation code
3. Modify pyproject.toml to reflect the new package name, including:
   - Package metadata (name) in [project] section
   - Entry points in [project.scripts] section
4. Update any references in README.md and other documentation
5. Update configuration files like .mcp-journalrc.yaml to reflect the new name
6. Check for hardcoded references to the package name in:
   - CLI commands
   - Configuration files
   - Environment variables
   - Log messages
7. Update any CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows, etc.) that reference the package name
8. Ensure compatibility with Task 3 (Git Utilities)

This rename should be done early in the development process to minimize technical debt.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the successful completion of this task:

1. Run a comprehensive search across the codebase to ensure no instances of 'mcp_journal' remain:
   ```
   grep -r "mcp_journal" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" --include="*.toml" --include="*.yaml" .
   ```

2. Verify the package can be installed correctly:
   ```
   # Uninstall old package if needed
   pip uninstall mcp_journal -y
   # Install new package
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the full test suite to ensure all functionality works with the new package name:
   ```
   pytest
   ```

4. Verify imports work in a new Python environment:
   ```python
   from mcp_commit_story import *
   # Test basic functionality
   ```

5. Check that any CLI commands or entry points still function:
   ```
   mcp-commit-story --version  # or whatever the command is
   ```

6. Run CI/CD pipelines to ensure they pass with the new package name

# Subtasks:

### Details:
1. Create a new directory 'src/mcp_commit_story/'
2. Copy all files from 'src/mcp_journal/' to 'src/mcp_commit_story/'
3. Update all import statements within the package files that reference 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story'
4. Ensure __init__.py and package structure is maintained
5. Do not delete the original directory yet

## 2. Update test files and external imports [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update all import statements in test files and any examples or documentation code to reference the new package name.
### Details:
1. Identify all test files in the 'tests/' directory
2. Update all import statements from 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story'
3. Check for any example code in documentation or standalone examples
4. Update imports in those files as well
5. Run tests to verify they pass with the new imports

## 3. Update package configuration in pyproject.toml [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify pyproject.toml to reflect the new package name, including package metadata and entry points.
### Details:
1. Update the package name in the [project] section
2. Update any references in dependencies or dev dependencies
3. Update entry points in [project.scripts] section
4. Update any other metadata that references the old package name
5. Verify the package can still be installed locally with pip install -e .

## 4. Update documentation and configuration files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update README.md, configuration files, and check for hardcoded references to the package name in various locations.
### Details:
1. Update README.md with the new package name

   - Configuration files
   - Environment variables
   - Log messages
4. Check for any other documentation files that need updating

## 5. Update CI/CD configuration and clean up [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update any CI/CD configuration files that reference the package name and remove the old package directory after verifying everything works.
### Details:
1. Update any GitHub workflow files in .github/workflows/
2. Check for any other CI/CD configuration that might reference the old name
3. Run a full verification of the package functionality
4. Once everything is confirmed working, delete the original 'src/mcp_journal/' directory
5. Verify the package still works after removal of the old directory
