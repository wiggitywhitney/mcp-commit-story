# Task ID: 16
# Title: Prioritize Manual Reflections in Summary Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the summary generation algorithm to prioritize user-added manual reflections over inferred content in daily, weekly, and monthly summaries, ensuring that intentional user input is prominently displayed.
# Details:
This task involves restructuring the summary generation process to give precedence to manual reflections. Key implementation details include:

1. Identify all manual reflections within the summary period (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. Modify the summary template to include a dedicated "Manual Reflections" section at the beginning of each summary
3. Apply visual highlighting (e.g., different formatting, color, or icons) to distinguish manual reflections from inferred content
4. Update the sorting algorithm to prioritize manual reflections chronologically at the top of summaries
5. Ensure that inferred mood, tone, or accomplishments appear after manual reflections, with clear visual separation
6. Implement fallback logic for periods with no manual reflections to gracefully handle this case
7. Update the summary preview functionality to reflect these changes
8. Maintain backward compatibility with existing summary data structures
9. Document the changes in the summary generation process for future reference
10. Consider adding a configuration option to allow users to toggle this behavior if desired

The implementation should build upon the existing manual reflection functionality from Task #13 and integrate with the current summary generation system.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Verify that manual reflections are correctly identified and extracted from journal entries
   - Test the sorting algorithm to ensure manual reflections appear before inferred content
   - Validate that the summary template correctly positions manual reflections at the beginning

2. Integration tests:
   - Create test journals with various combinations of manual and inferred content
   - Generate summaries for different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) and verify correct prioritization
   - Test edge cases: summaries with only manual reflections, only inferred content, or no content at all

3. UI/UX tests:
   - Verify that manual reflections are visually distinct and prominently displayed in the UI
   - Test that the visual hierarchy clearly communicates the importance of manual reflections
   - Ensure responsive design maintains this prioritization across different devices and screen sizes

4. User acceptance testing:
   - Create test scenarios with sample journal data containing both manual reflections and inferred content
   - Have test users review summaries to confirm that manual reflections are more noticeable
   - Collect feedback on the effectiveness of the prioritization implementation

5. Regression testing:
   - Verify that existing summary functionality remains intact
   - Ensure that historical summaries can be regenerated with the new prioritization rules if needed

Document all test results with screenshots comparing before and after implementations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Extract Manual Reflections from Summary Period [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to identify and extract all manual reflections within a given summary period (daily, weekly, monthly).
### Details:
Implement a new function `extractManualReflections(startDate, endDate)` that queries the database for all manual reflections created between the specified dates. The function should return an array of reflection objects sorted chronologically. Each object should contain the reflection text, timestamp, and any associated metadata. This function will serve as the foundation for prioritizing manual reflections in the summary generation process.

## 2. Modify Summary Templates to Include Dedicated Manual Reflections Section [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Update the summary templates for daily, weekly, and monthly views to include a dedicated section for manual reflections at the beginning.
### Details:
Modify the existing summary template structure to add a new 'Manual Reflections' section that appears before any inferred content. Design the section with appropriate headings and styling to make it visually distinct. Include conditional rendering logic to hide this section if no manual reflections exist for the period. Update the template rendering engine to pass the extracted manual reflections to this new section.

## 3. Implement Visual Highlighting for Manual Reflections [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create visual differentiation between manual reflections and inferred content in summaries through styling, icons, or formatting.
### Details:
Design and implement a visual system to distinguish manual reflections from inferred content. Add CSS classes to manual reflection elements that apply distinct styling (e.g., different background color, border, or font weight). Consider adding an icon indicator next to manual reflections. Ensure the styling is consistent across all summary types and responsive to different screen sizes. Update the summary rendering code to apply these visual indicators when displaying manual reflections.

## 4. Update Summary Generation Algorithm to Prioritize Manual Reflections [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Modify the core summary generation algorithm to prioritize manual reflections and ensure they appear before inferred content.
### Details:
Refactor the existing summary generation algorithm to incorporate the extracted manual reflections at the beginning of the summary. Implement the sorting logic to display manual reflections chronologically. Create clear visual separation between the manual reflections section and subsequent inferred content. Develop fallback logic that gracefully handles periods with no manual reflections by showing only inferred content with appropriate messaging. Ensure the algorithm maintains backward compatibility with existing summary data structures.

## 5. Update Summary Preview and Add User Configuration Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Update the summary preview functionality to reflect the new prioritization and add user configuration options for controlling this behavior.
### Details:
Modify the summary preview component to accurately display the new prioritized structure with manual reflections. Implement a user configuration option in the settings panel that allows users to toggle between prioritized manual reflections and the original summary format. Create appropriate UI controls and persistence for this preference. Update the documentation to explain the new summary generation process and configuration options. Test the preview functionality to ensure it accurately represents the final summary output.

## 6. Review and update README/docs [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Review and update the README.md and other documentation to reflect changes made in this task. Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and up to date.
