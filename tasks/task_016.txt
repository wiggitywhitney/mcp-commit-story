# Task ID: 16
# Title: Rename Python Package from 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story'
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Rename the Python package from 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story' to align with the repository name, including all necessary code and configuration updates to maintain functionality.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive package rename to ensure consistency between the codebase and repository name. The developer should:

1. Create a branch specifically for this rename operation
2. Rename the source directory from 'mcp_journal' to 'mcp_commit_story'
3. Update all import statements throughout the codebase, including:
   - Internal imports within the package
   - Import statements in test files
   - Any examples or documentation code
4. Modify pyproject.toml to reflect the new package name, including:
   - Package metadata (name, description)
   - Entry points
   - Build configuration
5. Update any references in README.md and other documentation
6. Check for hardcoded references to the package name in:
   - CLI commands
   - Configuration files
   - Environment variables
   - Log messages
7. Update any CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows, etc.) that reference the package name
8. Ensure compatibility with Task 3 (Git Utilities) by coordinating with the developer responsible for that task
9. Create a migration guide for other developers to understand the change

This rename should be done early in the development process to minimize technical debt but should not block current in-progress tasks. The developer should coordinate with the team to find an appropriate time window for merging these changes.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the successful completion of this task:

1. Run a comprehensive search across the codebase to ensure no instances of 'mcp_journal' remain:
   ```
   grep -r "mcp_journal" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" --include="*.toml" .
   ```

2. Verify the package can be installed correctly:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the full test suite to ensure all functionality works with the new package name:
   ```
   pytest
   ```

4. Verify imports work in a new Python environment:
   ```python
   from mcp_commit_story import *
   # Test basic functionality
   ```

5. Check that any CLI commands or entry points still function:
   ```
   mcp-commit-story --version  # or whatever the command is
   ```

6. Run CI/CD pipelines to ensure they pass with the new package name

7. Have another developer review the changes to ensure nothing was missed

8. Create a test plan for other developers to verify their work is compatible with the renamed package

9. Document any issues encountered during testing and their resolutions
