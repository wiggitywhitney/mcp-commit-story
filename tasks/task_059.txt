# Task ID: 59
# Title: Fix pytest temporary directory cleanup warnings
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve pytest warnings about failing to clean up temporary directories by fixing permission restoration issues and ensuring proper cleanup of resources in test files.
# Details:
This task involves systematically addressing pytest warnings related to temporary directory cleanup failures across multiple test files. The implementation should:

1. Review and fix each identified test file:
   - tests/unit/test_cli.py: Add proper permission restoration in finally blocks after chmod operations
   - tests/unit/test_cursor_db_exceptions.py: Ensure permission changes are properly reverted
   - tests/unit/test_git_hook_installation.py: Restore hooks directory permissions after tests
   - tests/unit/test_journal_init.py: Fix directory permission tests to properly clean up
   - tests/unit/test_database_connection.py: Ensure file permission changes are reverted
   - Integration tests: Review all uses of tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()

2. Implement proper resource management patterns:
   ```python
   # Example pattern for permission changes
   original_mode = os.stat(path).st_mode
   try:
       os.chmod(path, new_mode)
       # Test code here
   finally:
       os.chmod(path, original_mode)
   ```

3. Replace direct tempfile usage with pytest fixtures where appropriate:
   ```python
   # Instead of
   with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
       # test code
   
   # Use pytest fixtures
   def test_something(tmp_path):
       # test code using tmp_path
   ```

4. Ensure all file handles are properly closed by using context managers:
   ```python
   with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
       f.write('content')
   ```

5. Add explicit cleanup for any subdirectories or files created during tests:
   ```python
   try:
       # Create subdirectories/files
       # Test code
   finally:
       # Clean up subdirectories/files
       shutil.rmtree(subdir_path, ignore_errors=True)
   ```

6. Review and fix any tests that might be creating files with insufficient permissions for deletion.

7. Consider implementing a custom pytest fixture that handles permission restoration automatically for tests that need to modify permissions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the pytest suite with the `-v` flag and verify no temporary directory cleanup warnings are generated:
   ```
   pytest -v
   ```

2. Add specific tests for each fixed file to ensure the functionality still works as expected:
   ```
   pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py -v
   pytest tests/unit/test_cursor_db_exceptions.py -v
   pytest tests/unit/test_git_hook_installation.py -v
   pytest tests/unit/test_journal_init.py -v
   pytest tests/unit/test_database_connection.py -v
   ```

3. Run the tests with the `--keep-tempdir` flag to inspect the temporary directories after test execution and verify they're properly cleaned up:
   ```
   pytest --keep-tempdir
   ```

4. Create a test that specifically checks for resource leaks:
   ```python
   def test_no_resource_leaks():
       # Use psutil to check for open file handles before and after running tests
       import psutil
       process = psutil.Process()
       handles_before = process.open_files()
       # Run test operations
       handles_after = process.open_files()
       assert len(handles_after) <= len(handles_before)
   ```

5. Run the tests in a loop (e.g., 10 times) to ensure consistent cleanup:
   ```
   for i in {1..10}; do pytest tests/unit/test_cli.py; done
   ```

6. Monitor disk space before and after running the test suite multiple times to ensure no accumulation of temporary files.

7. Verify that all tests still pass and maintain the same functionality after the fixes.
