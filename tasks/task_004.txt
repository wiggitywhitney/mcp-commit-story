# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Telemetry System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up OpenTelemetry integration for tracing, metrics, and logging to provide observability for the MCP server.
# Details:
Implement telemetry system in `src/mcp_journal/telemetry.py` with the following features:

1. OpenTelemetry setup:
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource

def setup_telemetry(config):
    """Initialize OpenTelemetry based on configuration"""
    if not config.get("telemetry.enabled", True):
        return
        
    service_name = config.get("telemetry.service_name", "mcp-journal")
    resource = Resource(attributes={SERVICE_NAME: service_name})
    
    tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
    trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)
    
    # Configure exporters based on config
    # ...
```

2. Tracing utilities:
```python
def get_tracer(name="mcp_journal"):
    """Get a tracer for the specified name"""
    return trace.get_tracer(name)

def trace_operation(name):
    """Decorator for tracing operations"""
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            tracer = get_tracer()
            with tracer.start_as_current_span(name):
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

3. Metrics collection:
```python
# Setup metrics collection for key operations
# Track operation duration, success/failure, etc.
```

4. Logging integration:
```python
import logging

def setup_logging(debug=False):
    """Configure logging with appropriate levels"""
    level = logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO
    logging.basicConfig(level=level)
    # Additional logging configuration
```

## TDD Step 1 Complete: TESTS WRITTEN AND VERIFIED TO FAIL

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_mcp_server_telemetry_integration.py` with 18 tests covering:

**MCP Server Integration Tests:**
- Server startup with telemetry enabled/disabled
- Configuration validation (invalid configs, missing fields)
- Tool call tracing end-to-end 
- Span propagation across components
- Metrics collection during operations
- Telemetry enable/disable scenarios
- Shutdown hooks and health checks
- Error handling for telemetry failures
- Config hot reload with telemetry

**Telemetry System Integration Tests:**
- TracerProvider/MeterProvider initialization
- Structured logging integration
- MCPMetrics initialization 
- Service resource configuration

**Test Results - FAILING AS EXPECTED (5 failed, 13 passed):**

1. **telemetry_disabled test failure**: setup_telemetry not being called when disabled - indicates current server logic doesn't call setup_telemetry when telemetry is disabled

2. **tool_call_tracing failures**: Mock context manager setup issues and tool validation errors - need to fix request format and improve tracing integration

3. **config validation failure**: Missing journal.path in minimal config - need to handle defaults properly

4. **Key Integration Points Identified:**
   - Current server.py calls `setup_telemetry` conditionally based on config.telemetry_enabled
   - Need to enhance tool handlers with tracing decorators
   - Need to add metrics collection to MCP operations
   - Need to improve error handling for telemetry failures

**Next Steps:**
- Move to Design Approval phase
- Identify specific integration points in server lifecycle
- Design tracing decorator application strategy
- Plan metrics collection points

<info added on 2025-05-31T11:50:20.799Z>
## TDD Step 2 Complete: DESIGN CHOICES APPROVED

✅ **All design choices approved by user with enhancements:**

**1. Integration Points**: Early Integration (Option A) - Complete coverage from server startup
**2. Configuration Schema**: Enhanced with exporters configuration:
```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
  service_name: 'mcp-commit-story'
  service_version: '1.0.0'
  deployment_environment: 'development'
  exporters:                         # NEW
    console:
      enabled: true
    otlp:
      enabled: false
  auto_instrumentation:
    enabled: true
    preset: 'minimal'
```

**3. Tracing Strategy**: Hybrid approach - Manual but consistent decoration:
```python
@server.tool()
@trace_mcp_operation("journal_new_entry")
async def journal_new_entry(request):
    return await handle_journal_new_entry(request)
```

**4. Metrics Collection**: Approved base metrics + additional:
- Tool call counts/durations (success/failure)
- Server startup time, active operations, config reloads, error rates
- **NEW**: mcp_git_operations_total, mcp_file_operations_total, mcp_context_collection_duration_seconds

**5. Performance Thresholds**: ✅ APPROVED
- < 5ms overhead per tool call
- < 1MB memory overhead  
- < 10% CPU overhead

**6. Data Volume**: ✅ APPROVED (~1MB daily for moderate usage)

**Implementation Strategy Approved:**
- Phased rollout (tracing → metrics → logging → OTLP/Prometheus)
- Environment-specific defaults
- Graceful error handling (don't block server startup)

**Ready to proceed with Step 3: IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY**

4. DOCUMENT AND COMPLETE:
   - Add documentation IF NEEDED in three places:
     1. **Docs directory**: Update telemetry.md with Git operation instrumentation and context collection monitoring
     2. **PRD**: Update if adding user-facing context collection monitoring features
     3. **Engineering Spec**: Update with context collection telemetry implementation details and make sure TOC is current
   - **Do not remove existing information unless it's incorrect**
   - **No approval needed** - make documentation edits directly
   - **Run the entire test suite and make sure all tests are passing**
   - **Make sure pyproject.toml is updated as needed**
   - Double check all subtask requirements are met before marking this subtask as complete
   - **MARK COMPLETE**

## 10. Instrument Configuration Management (Task 6) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add telemetry to existing config loading and validation for system initialization observability
### Details:
TDD Steps:

1. WRITE TESTS FIRST:
   - Test configuration loading time tracking
   - Test validation success/failure metrics
   - Test configuration change detection
   - Test environment variable resolution tracing
   - Test sensitive value masking
   - Test configuration reload events
   - Test configuration → MCP server startup flow
   - RUN TESTS - VERIFY THEY FAIL

2. GET APPROVAL FOR DESIGN CHOICES:
   - Configuration value privacy (mask sensitive values)
   - Validation error detail level in spans
   - Configuration reload event tracking
   - Configuration metrics granularity
   - PAUSE FOR MANUAL APPROVAL

3. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Add tracing decorators to config.py functions
   - Instrument config loading with duration metrics
   - Add validation error tracking with context
   - Implement sensitive value masking
   - Create configuration change detection
   - Add configuration reload event tracking
   - Trace configuration → MCP server startup flow
   - RUN TESTS - VERIFY THEY PASS

## 11. Instrument Integration Tests for Telemetry Validation (Task 8) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add telemetry awareness to existing integration tests for end-to-end observability validation
### Details:
TDD Steps:

1. WRITE TESTS FIRST:
   - Test integration tests generate expected spans
   - Test trace continuity across MCP tool chains
   - Test metrics collection during integration scenarios
   - Test telemetry doesn't break existing integration tests
   - Test span attribute correctness
   - Test metric value correctness
   - Test telemetry in error scenarios
   - RUN TESTS - VERIFY THEY FAIL

2. GET APPROVAL FOR DESIGN CHOICES:
   - Integration test telemetry scope
   - Test environment telemetry configuration
   - Telemetry assertion patterns in tests
   - Mock vs real telemetry backends for testing
   - PAUSE FOR MANUAL APPROVAL

3. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Update existing integration tests to validate telemetry
   - Add telemetry configuration for test environments
   - Create telemetry assertion helpers
