# Task ID: 67
# Title: Add Code Diff Collection to Git Context
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend git context collection to include actual code diffs alongside existing metadata, enabling AI generators to analyze specific code changes when creating journal entries.
# Details:
This task involves extending the git context collection functionality to include actual code diffs, providing AI generators with more detailed information about code changes:

1. **Update GitContext TypedDict**:
   - Modify `context_types.py` to add a new `file_diffs` field to the GitContext TypedDict:
   ```python
   class GitContext(TypedDict):
       # Existing fields
       commit_hash: str
       commit_message: str
       commit_time: str
       author_name: str
       author_email: str
       files_changed: list[str]
       # New field
       file_diffs: dict[str, str]  # Mapping of file paths to their diffs
   ```

2. **Extend get_commit_file_diffs() in git_utils.py**:
   - Modify the function to collect actual diff content using GitPython's `commit.diff(parent, create_patch=True)`
   - Implement size limits and filtering logic:
   ```python
   def get_commit_file_diffs(repo, commit, max_file_size=10*1024, max_total_size=50*1024):
       """Get the diffs for files changed in a commit with size limits.
       
       Args:
           repo: GitPython repository object
           commit: GitPython commit object
           max_file_size: Maximum size in bytes for individual file diffs (default: 10KB)
           max_total_size: Maximum total size in bytes for all diffs combined (default: 50KB)
           
       Returns:
           dict: Mapping of file paths to their diffs
       """
       file_diffs = {}
       total_size = 0
       
       # Get parent commit (or None for initial commit)
       parent = commit.parents[0] if commit.parents else None
       
       # Process each file in the commit
       for diff_item in commit.diff(parent, create_patch=True):
           # Skip binary files
           if diff_item.binary:
               continue
               
           # Skip generated files (based on path patterns)
           file_path = diff_item.b_path
           if is_generated_file(file_path):
               continue
               
           # Get the diff content
           diff_content = diff_item.diff.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
           
           # Apply size limits
           if len(diff_content) > max_file_size:
               # Truncate with message
               diff_content = diff_content[:max_file_size] + "\n[... diff truncated due to size limits ...]"
           
           # Check if adding this diff would exceed total size limit
           if total_size + len(diff_content) > max_total_size:
               # If we've already collected some diffs, stop here
               if file_diffs:
                   file_diffs["__truncated__"] = "Additional diffs omitted due to total size limits"
                   break
               # If this is the first diff and it's already too large, include it truncated
               diff_content = diff_content[:max_total_size] + "\n[... remaining diffs truncated due to size limits ...]"
           
           # Add to collection
           file_diffs[file_path] = diff_content
           total_size += len(diff_content)
       
       return file_diffs
   ```

3. **Add helper functions for file filtering**:
   ```python
   def is_generated_file(file_path):
       """Determine if a file is likely generated based on path patterns."""
       generated_patterns = [
           r'\.min\.(js|css)$',
           r'package-lock\.json$',
           r'yarn\.lock$',
           r'__pycache__/',
           r'\.pyc$',
           r'build/|dist/',
           r'node_modules/'
       ]
       return any(re.search(pattern, file_path) for pattern in generated_patterns)
   ```

4. **Modify collect_git_context() in context_collection.py**:
   - Update to include the file diffs in the returned GitContext:
   ```python
   def collect_git_context(repo_path=None, max_file_diff_size=10*1024, max_total_diff_size=50*1024, include_diffs=True):
       """Collect git context for the current repository state.
       
       Args:
           repo_path: Path to git repository (default: current directory)
           max_file_diff_size: Maximum size for individual file diffs
           max_total_diff_size: Maximum total size for all diffs
           include_diffs: Whether to include file diffs (can be disabled for performance)
           
       Returns:
           GitContext: Context information about the git repository
       """
       # Existing code to get basic git context...
       
       # Add file diffs if enabled
       if include_diffs:
           context["file_diffs"] = get_commit_file_diffs(
               repo, 
               commit, 
               max_file_size=max_file_diff_size,
               max_total_size=max_total_diff_size
           )
       else:
           context["file_diffs"] = {}
           
       return context
   ```

5. **Add configuration options**:
   - Update configuration schema to include diff collection settings:
   ```python
   # In config.py or similar
   DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
       # Existing config...
       "git_context": {
           "include_diffs": True,
           "max_file_diff_size": 10 * 1024,  # 10KB
           "max_total_diff_size": 50 * 1024,  # 50KB
           "file_type_whitelist": [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".jsx", ".tsx", ".html", ".css", ".md", ".txt"],
           "exclude_generated_files": True
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Add telemetry for performance monitoring**:
   ```python
   @trace_mcp_operation
   def get_commit_file_diffs(repo, commit, max_file_size=10*1024, max_total_size=50*1024):
       telemetry.start_span("get_commit_file_diffs")
       try:
           # Implementation as above
           telemetry.add_attribute("num_files_processed", len(file_diffs))
           telemetry.add_attribute("total_diff_size", total_size)
           return file_diffs
       finally:
           telemetry.end_span()
   ```

7. **Ensure backward compatibility**:
   - Make sure existing code that uses GitContext still works by providing defaults or handling missing fields
   - Update any AI generators to take advantage of the new diff information when available

# Test Strategy:
To verify the correct implementation of code diff collection in git context:

1. **Unit Tests for Diff Collection**:
   ```python
   def test_get_commit_file_diffs():
       """Test that commit file diffs are correctly collected with size limits."""
       # Create a test repository with a commit containing multiple files
       repo = create_test_repo()
       add_test_files(repo, ["file1.py", "file2.py", "large_file.py", "binary_file.bin"])
       commit = make_test_commit(repo)
       
       # Test basic diff collection
       diffs = get_commit_file_diffs(repo, commit)
       assert "file1.py" in diffs
       assert "file2.py" in diffs
       assert isinstance(diffs["file1.py"], str)
       
       # Test binary file exclusion
       assert "binary_file.bin" not in diffs
       
       # Test size limits
       diffs = get_commit_file_diffs(repo, commit, max_file_size=10, max_total_size=15)
       assert len(diffs["file1.py"]) <= 10
       assert "truncated" in diffs["file1.py"]
       assert "__truncated__" in diffs
   ```

2. **Integration Tests with Context Collection**:
   ```python
   def test_git_context_with_diffs():
       """Test that git context includes diffs when requested."""
       # Setup test repository
       repo_path = setup_test_repo()
       
       # Test with diffs enabled
       context = collect_git_context(repo_path, include_diffs=True)
       assert "file_diffs" in context
       assert len(context["file_diffs"]) > 0
       
       # Test with diffs disabled
       context = collect_git_context(repo_path, include_diffs=False)
       assert "file_diffs" in context
       assert len(context["file_diffs"]) == 0
   ```

3. **Configuration Tests**:
   ```python
   def test_git_context_config():
       """Test that git context respects configuration settings."""
       # Setup test repository
       repo_path = setup_test_repo()
       
       # Test with custom config
       config = {
           "git_context": {
               "include_diffs": True,
               "max_file_diff_size": 100,
               "max_total_diff_size": 200
           }
       }
       context = collect_git_context(repo_path, 
                                    max_file_diff_size=config["git_context"]["max_file_diff_size"],
                                    max_total_diff_size=config["git_context"]["max_total_diff_size"],
                                    include_diffs=config["git_context"]["include_diffs"])
       
       # Verify size limits were applied
       for diff in context["file_diffs"].values():
           assert len(diff) <= 100
   ```

4. **Performance Tests**:
   ```python
   def test_diff_collection_performance():
       """Test performance of diff collection with large repositories."""
       # Setup large test repository
       repo_path = setup_large_test_repo()
       
       # Measure performance
       start_time = time.time()
       context = collect_git_context(repo_path)
       duration = time.time() - start_time
       
       # Assert reasonable performance
       assert duration < 2.0  # Should complete in under 2 seconds
   ```

5. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test with real repositories of varying sizes
   - Verify that diff collection works with different types of changes (additions, deletions, modifications)
   - Check that the diffs are correctly formatted and readable
   - Verify that binary files are correctly excluded
   - Test with repositories containing non-ASCII characters

6. **AI Generator Integration Test**:
   - Create a test that passes the enhanced git context to an AI generator
   - Verify that the generator can access and utilize the diff information
   - Check that the generated content references specific code changes from the diffs
