# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Cursor Chat Database Integration for Journal Context Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the journal context collection by implementing direct SQLite integration with the Cursor chat database to access complete conversation history instead of limited recent messages, using git changes as semantic search criteria to intelligently select relevant chat segments.
# Details:
This task involves significant improvements to the context collection system by directly accessing the Cursor chat database, implemented in five distinct phases:

## Phase 0: Strategic Research

1. Cursor-chat-browser Deep Analysis:
   - Extract workspace detection algorithms from https://github.com/thomas-pedersen/cursor-chat-browser (397+ stars, battle-tested)
   - Document their message parsing patterns and JSON structure navigation
   - Map their cross-platform path handling (Windows/macOS/Linux/WSL2)
   - Understand their error recovery mechanisms and permission handling
   - Study their search/filtering patterns for boundary detection insights
   - Analyze performance characteristics with large chat histories

2. Message Completeness Validation:
   - Confirm AI response storage locations (ensure both human AND AI messages captured)
   - Test conversation threading and context preservation across sessions
   - Validate timestamp accuracy, formats, and timezone handling
   - Document metadata availability and conversation session identification
   - Test message attribution patterns (human vs AI)

3. Implementation Confidence Validation:
   - Verify compatibility with current Cursor versions
   - Validate support for our journal generation use cases
   - Confirm complete message access (human + AI)
   - Verify intelligent boundary detection capabilities
   - Test cross-platform compatibility
   - Document error handling patterns
   - Understand performance characteristics

## Phase 1: Core SQLite Integration (MVP)

1. Remove the current limited `collect_ai_chat_context` function from `context_collection.py` that only captures recent messages.

2. Add a new SQLite reader function to `context_collection.py` that can:
   - Use Python's built-in sqlite3 module (no external dependencies)
   - Implement multi-method workspace detection based on cursor-chat-browser patterns:
     * Windows: %APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage
     * WSL2: /mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage
     * macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage
     * Linux: ~/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage
     * Linux (remote/SSH): ~/.cursor-server/data/User/workspaceStorage
   - Implement workspace hash discovery and validation logic
   - Include user configuration fallback for edge cases
   - Implement proper error handling for missing or inaccessible databases

3. Implement a direct database query function that:
   - Queries the `ItemTable` where `key='aiService.prompts'` to extract the complete conversation history
   - Ensures both human and AI messages are captured (not just human side)
   - Handles message threading and conversation context preservation
   - Extracts timestamps and metadata for intelligent boundary detection
   - Parses the returned JSON format into a structured conversation history
   - Includes appropriate error handling and logging

## Phase 2: Context Integration

4. Update the downstream components in the `generate_journal_entry` functions to:
   - Process FOUR distinct context sources: git, terminal, cursor chat database, and synthesized summary
   - Handle cases where some context sources might be unavailable
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing journal generation

5. Implement git-driven chat relevance detection:
   - Use git changes (files, functions, variables) as semantic search criteria to find relevant chat segments
   - Extract key terms, function names, and concepts from git diffs
   - Implement semantic matching between code changes and chat content
   - Score and rank chat segments by relevance to code changes
   - Prioritize chat segments that directly discuss the modified code elements
   - Include both recent and historical chat segments that relate to the current changes
   - Support fuzzy matching for partial or conceptual references to code elements

6. Implement chat boundary detection logic:
   - Implement smart boundary detection using complete chat history access
   - Consider conversation breaks, topic changes, or manual delimiters
   - Provide configurable limits with intelligent defaults based on cursor-chat-browser insights
   - Implement topic change detection mechanisms and session separation logic
   - Support for both automatic and manual boundary configuration
   - Ensure boundaries preserve the context of git-relevant chat segments

## Phase 3: Enhancement Features

7. Create a new synthesized summary collection function that:
   - Uses AI prompts to generate high-level summaries of conversations
   - Provides configuration options for summary detail level and focus areas
   - Handles rate limiting and API errors gracefully
   - Emphasizes the relationship between chat segments and code changes
   - Captures the thinking process behind implementation decisions

8. Implement caching mechanisms for performance:
   - Avoid regenerating summaries unnecessarily
   - Optimize database query performance
   - Implement configuration caching for performance optimization
   - Cache semantic search results for similar git changes

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

9. Implement cross-platform support considerations:
   - Leverage proven cursor-chat-browser patterns for cross-platform compatibility
   - Handle path variations across operating systems (Windows/macOS/Linux/WSL2)
   - Implement permission handling with clear error messages for database access issues
   - Create repeatable setup for any end user's environment with auto-detection
   - Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux

10. Address packaging considerations:
    - Zero external dependencies (using built-in sqlite3)
    - Document installation requirements for end users
    - Provide fallback mechanisms when database access is not available
    - Implement robust error recovery mechanisms for corrupted/missing databases
