# Task ID: 72
# Title: Integrate Tagging System into Daily Summary Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 71
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the daily summary generation system to leverage the tagging and narrative threading system from task 71, enabling daily summaries to surface story arcs, recurring themes, and emotional-technical connections.

# Requirements:
- Integrate tagging system from task 71 into daily summary generation workflow
- Enable daily summaries to detect and display recurring themes from journal entries
- Incorporate emotion-tech pairing insights into daily summary structure
- Implement narrative threading to connect story arcs within daily summaries
- Add AI-as-character elements to daily summary generation prompts
- Maintain existing daily summary functionality while adding tagging capabilities
- Ensure tagged content is properly preserved and displayed in summary output
- Add comprehensive testing for tagging integration with daily summaries
- Update telemetry to track tagging system usage and effectiveness in daily summaries
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing daily summary consumers

# Notes:
## Initial Context:
- Task 71 provides the core tagging system with #breakthrough, #AI-misstep, #pivot, #recurring-issue tags
- Daily summaries should leverage this tagging to create more narrative-driven content
- Need to consider how tagging fits into existing daily summary structure and format

## Design Decisions for Future Consideration:

### Architecture Questions:
1. **Summary Structure Philosophy**: Should journal sections remain consistent between entries and summaries, or should summaries have their own specialized sections?

2. **Individual Generator Pattern**: Should we create separate generators for different summary types (daily, weekly, monthly)?

3. **Tagging Integration Point**: Where should tagging be applied in the daily summary workflow?

4. **Narrative Threading Scope**: How much narrative context should daily summaries include?

5. **Story Arc Discovery**: How should daily summaries help surface longer story arcs?

## Implementation Strategy:
- TBD after design decisions are made during Phase 2 discussion
