### 2025-05-21 06:08 — Commit b11f253

#### Summary

Implemented comprehensive formatting improvements for journal entry generation, including header hierarchy, spacing, code block consistency, and blockquote clarity. All changes were developed using a strict TDD approach, with new tests added and verified for each formatting rule. This update enhances the readability and maintainability of engineering journal entries.

#### Accomplishments
- Refactored `JournalEntry.to_markdown()` to support:

- H3 for entry header and H4 for section headers

- Blank lines after section headers and between bullet points

- Blank lines on speaker change in discussion notes

- Terminal commands as a single bash code block

- Visually distinct blockquotes

- Added and updated tests in `tests/test_journal_entry.py` to cover all new formatting rules

- Updated documentation and task files to reflect new formatting requirements

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor confusion around code block counting in tests (opening/closing markers)

- Needed to adjust test logic to match markdown conventions

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Please make a journal entry for this git commit as outlined in engineering spec. Put it in a new markdown file called day-03-sample-journal-entry.md

> **Agent:** All formatting improvements are implemented and fully covered by passing tests. The two previously failing tests were corrected to match the intended logic and now also pass. You are ready to mark subtask 5.9 as complete.

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> All formatting improvements are now robustly tested and the codebase is more maintainable.

### 2025-05-21 06:45 — Commit bbe7723

#### Summary

Advanced the core infrastructure for engineering journal management by implementing and testing file operations. This work lays the foundation for reliable, structured, and extensible journal entry storage, following the project's narrative-first and signal-over-noise philosophy. The approach ensures that future entries will be easy to locate, append, and analyze, supporting the long-term goal of meaningful engineering storytelling.

#### Accomplishments
- Designed and implemented `get_journal_file_path()` to enforce consistent, date-based file naming for all journal and summary types.
- Built `create_journal_directories()` to guarantee the required directory structure exists before writing, reducing friction for future features.
- Developed `append_to_journal_file()` to robustly append entries, insert horizontal rules for clarity, and create files as needed.
- Wrote and validated comprehensive TDD tests for all file operations, including error handling and edge cases.
- Ensured all file operations are modular and ready for integration with higher-level journal logic.

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Encountered minor ambiguity in how to best parameterize file naming for future summary types (weekly, monthly, yearly).
- Needed to balance simplicity with extensibility, as much of the higher-level journal logic is not yet implemented.
- Some uncertainty about how future context collection and section generation will interact with file operations.

#### Terminal Commands (AI Session)
Commands executed by AI during this work session:
```bash
git commit -m "Implement file operations with tests"
git show --stat --patch bbe7723
git diff --stat bbe7723^ bbe7723
git diff --unified=0 bbe7723^ bbe7723 | head -n 40
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%an' bbe7723
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%ad' --date=short bbe7723
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h' bbe7723
git log -1 --pretty=format:'%s' bbe7723
```

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Please make another entry for the same commit. This time additionally use journal.py as a reference for formatting and content guidelines, but keep in mind that much of the code here isn't implemented yet.

> **Agent:** All file operations functions are now implemented and fully passing their tests! The code matches your directory structure, naming conventions, and appending logic. The implementation automatically creates parent directories and handles file system errors as expected. All 8 TDD tests for file operations are green.

#### Tone/Mood
> Accomplished
> The file operations layer is now reliable, well-tested, and ready for integration with higher-level journal features.
