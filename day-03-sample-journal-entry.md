### 2025-05-21 06:08 â€” Commit b11f253

#### Summary

Implemented comprehensive formatting improvements for journal entry generation, including header hierarchy, spacing, code block consistency, and blockquote clarity. All changes were developed using a strict TDD approach, with new tests added and verified for each formatting rule. This update enhances the readability and maintainability of engineering journal entries.

#### Accomplishments
- Refactored `JournalEntry.to_markdown()` to support:

- H3 for entry header and H4 for section headers

- Blank lines after section headers and between bullet points

- Blank lines on speaker change in discussion notes

- Terminal commands as a single bash code block

- Visually distinct blockquotes

- Added and updated tests in `tests/test_journal_entry.py` to cover all new formatting rules

- Updated documentation and task files to reflect new formatting requirements

#### Frustrations or Roadblocks
- Minor confusion around code block counting in tests (opening/closing markers)

- Needed to adjust test logic to match markdown conventions

#### Discussion Notes (from chat)
> **Human:** Please make a journal entry for this git commit as outlined in engineering spec. Put it in a new markdown file called day-03-sample-journal-entry.md

> **Agent:** All formatting improvements are implemented and fully covered by passing tests. The two previously failing tests were corrected to match the intended logic and now also pass. You are ready to mark subtask 5.9 as complete.

#### Tone/Mood
> Satisfied
> All formatting improvements are now robustly tested and the codebase is more maintainable.
